# Ceremonies in Agile
Agile ceremonies are **meetings with defined lengths, frequencies, and goals**. Their purpose is to help project teams **plan, track, and engage stakeholders with their work** and help them reflect on how well they've worked together. They're typically a part of the **Scrum framework of Agile.**

## Sprint Planning:

Sprint planning is an event in the Scrum framework where the team determines the product backlog items they will work on during that **sprint and discusses their initial plan** for completing those product backlog items.

## Daily Scrum:
The purpose of the Daily Scrum is **to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work**. The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team.
## Sprint Review:

The sprint review is **a Scrum event that takes place at the end of the sprint, just before the retrospective**. The purpose of the review is to evaluate the latest features and to consider the plan for the product in the future.

## Sprint Retrospective

The sprint retrospective is  **a recurring meeting held at the end of a sprint used to discuss what went well during the previous sprint cycle and what can be improved for the next sprint**. The Agile sprint retrospective is an essential part of the Scrum framework for developing, delivering, and managing complex projects.
