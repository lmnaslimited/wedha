# Why Agile:
Product-based companies like LMNAs try to develop robust software products that often take months or years to complete. When these companies apply any Agile methodologies, **it allows them to share the project progress incrementally with the end users on a regular basis so that it becomes possible for them to verify and approve**. so LMNAs use agile

The 10th Annual State of Agile Report identified that **95% of organizations that practice Agile development processes have experienced exceptional success after their adoption.** Any company that aims to achieve faster results, better communication, and improved teamwork can benefit from Agile.

# Why Agile at LMNAs?
## Agile helps to incorporate customer feedback quickly
Customer feedback and its incorporation is extremely important for a productâ€™s success, but this is something that gets ignored very frequently. In a survey conducted, it was noticed that only 1% of all the respondents believed that their feedback was considered and the product met their expectations completely. 
## Agile helps with Improvement in Project Organization
Proper planning for any project is fundamental to its success. According to a survey conducted, nearly 35% of projects are not completely planned at the starting stage. This can result in failure. With Agile, this problem can be avoided.
## Agile Methods help with Team Building
The Agile method is highly focused on teamwork. One of the biggest reasons why Agile projects have a higher success rate is because Agile teams work together and collaborate. This is possible because of effective communication among team members.
## Agile teams help raise the level of productivity of their team
Agile methods help team members stay motivated. The short iterations show results quickly, which helps the team members see the actual workable product. This helps them in staying true to the main goal because there is visible proof of their progress. 
## Agile methods show teams how to use tools to their best ability
Another reason why so many organizations love to work using the Agile methodology in their teams is because of the level of efficiency that comes with using Agile tools. Agile tools help break down complex tasks easily into manageable ones that the team can work on. 
## Final thoughts
Implementing Agile has proven to be beneficial for many organizations, but Agile methodologies need to be implemented correctly in order for them to work. This is why training the workforce in popular Agile Certification Courses will be really helpful for organizations. Once teams get a better understanding of Agile processes they can inculcate the Agile mindset in their operations and work in a more Agile way.
