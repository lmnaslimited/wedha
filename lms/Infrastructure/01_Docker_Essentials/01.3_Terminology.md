# **Docker Terminologies**

### Docker Image:

A read-only template that includes the application code, libraries, environment variables, and dependencies needed to run an application. Images are stored in a Docker registry like Docker Hub.

### Docker Container:

A runnable instance of a Docker image. Containers are writable, lightweight, and run directly on the host machine's kernel, ensuring fast performance and consistency across different environments.

### :
A text file containing instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the base image, application dependencies, environment variables, and commands needed to create a new image.

### Resource Efficiency:
Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight and resource-efficient compared to traditional virtual machines. This allows you to run more containers on the same hardware.

### Scalability:
Docker supports scaling applications horizontally by running multiple container instances. This makes it easy to handle increased traffic and load by simply adding more containers.

### Isolation:
Containers run in isolated environments, ensuring that each application or service does not interfere with others. This isolation improves security and stability.

### Ease of Use:
Docker provides a simple command-line interface and graphical tools for managing containers, making it accessible for both developers and system administrators.
