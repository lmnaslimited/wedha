# **Docker Terminologies**

### Docker Image:

A read-only template that includes the application code, libraries, environment variables, and dependencies needed to run an application. Images are stored in a Docker registry like Docker Hub.

### Docker Container:

A runnable instance of a Docker image. Containers are writable, lightweight, and run directly on the host machine's kernel, ensuring fast performance and consistency across different environments.

### Dockerfile:
A text file containing instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the base image, application dependencies, environment variables, and commands needed to create a new image.

### Docker Hub:
A cloud-based repository where Docker images are stored and shared. It serves as the default registry for pulling images, with options for public and private repositories.

### Docker Compose:
A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a `docker-compose.yml` file. It simplifies managing complex applications by allowing you to start everything with a single command.

### Docker Engine:
The core component of Docker responsible for creating and running containers. It includes the Docker daemon, REST API, and Docker CLI.

### Docker Daemon:
 A background service (dockerd) that manages containers, images, networks, and volumes on the host machine. It listens to API requests and interacts with the operating system to execute tasks.

### Ease of Use:
Docker provides a simple command-line interface and graphical tools for managing containers, making it accessible for both developers and system administrators.
