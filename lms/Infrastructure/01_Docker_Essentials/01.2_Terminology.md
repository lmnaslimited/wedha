# **Docker Terminologies**

### Docker Image:

A read-only template that includes the application code, libraries, environment variables, and dependencies needed to run an application. Images are stored in a Docker registry like Docker Hub.

### Docker Container:

A runnable instance of a Docker image. Containers are writable, lightweight, and run directly on the host machine's kernel, ensuring fast performance and consistency across different environments.

### Dockerfile:
A text file containing instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the base image, application dependencies, environment variables, and commands needed to create a new image.

### Docker Compose:
A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a `docker-compose.yml` file. It simplifies managing complex applications by allowing you to start everything with a single command.

### Docker Engine:
The core component of Docker responsible for creating and running containers. It includes the Docker daemon, REST API, and Docker CLI.

### Docker Daemon:
 A background service (dockerd) that manages containers, images, networks, and volumes on the host machine. It listens to API requests and interacts with the operating system to execute tasks.

### Docker CLI:
 The command line interface for interacting with Docker through a terminal or command prompt. It includes commands like `docker run`, `docker build`, and `docker ps`.


### Volume:
A Docker volume is a storage mechanism used to store data outside of a container’s filesystem. This ensures that the data is preserved even if the container is removed or recreated.

-   **Named Volumes:**
    -   Managed by Docker.
    -   Stored in a Docker-specific directory on the host.
    -   Persist data across container restarts and removals.
    
-   **Anonymous Volumes:**
    -   Automatically created without a specific name.
    -   Managed by Docker.
    -   **Used for temporary data that doesn’t need to be retained after the container is removed.**
-   **Bind Mounts:**
    
    -   Map a specific host directory or file into the container.
    -   Reflect changes on the host inside the container and vice versa.
    -   Useful for development and sharing files.



### Orchestration :
The management of container deployment and scaling across a cluster of machines. Tools like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes provide orchestration features such as scaling, load balancing, and self-healing of containerized applications.
