# **Docker Terminologies**

###  Image:

A Docker image is an executable package that includes all the software, libraries, and configurations needed to run an application. It specifies how a container should be instantiated, detailing which components will run and how they should be configured.

### Container:

A runnable instance of a Docker image. Containers are writable, lightweight, and run directly on the host machine's kernel, ensuring fast performance and consistency across different environments.


### Network:
Docker networks enable communication between containers on the same or different hosts. Custom networks can be defined to control container interactions.
 
### Volume:
A Docker volume is a storage mechanism used to store data outside of a container’s filesystem. This ensures that the data is preserved even if the container is removed or recreated.

-   **Named Volumes:**
    -   Managed by Docker.
    -   Stored in a Docker-specific directory on the host.
    -   Persist data across container restarts and removals.
    
-   **Anonymous Volumes (Unnamed Volume):**
    -   Automatically created without a specific name.
    -   Managed by Docker.
    -   Used for temporary data that doesn’t need to be retained after the container is removed.
-   **Bind Mounts:**
    
    -   Map a specific host directory or file into the container.
    -   Useful for development and sharing files.

### Dockerfile:
A text file containing instructions for building a Docker image. It defines the base image, application dependencies, environment variables, and commands needed to create a new image.

### Docker Compose:
 Docker Compose is a software containerized tool developed to orchestrate the definitions and running of multi-container docker applications using single commands. It reads the definitions of the multiple containers from the single Configuration Yaml file and performs the orchestration with single-line commands making easy usage for developers.

### Docker Engine:
The core component of Docker responsible for creating and running containers. It includes the Docker daemon, REST API, and Docker CLI.
 
### Docker Daemon:
 A background service (dockerd) that manages containers, images, networks, and volumes on the host machine. It listens to API requests and interacts with the operating system to execute tasks.

### Docker CLI:
 The command line interface for interacting with Docker through a terminal or command prompt. It includes commands like `docker run`, `docker build`, and `docker ps`.

### Docker Hub:
 A cloud-based repository where Docker images are stored and shared. It serves as the default registry for pulling images, with options for public and private repositories

### Orchestration :
The management of container deployment and scaling across a cluster of machines. Tools like Docker Swarm and Kubernetes provide orchestration features such as scaling, load balancing, and self-healing of containerized applications.
