## 1\. Create a `docker-compose.yml` File

You can create a Docker Compose file with the default name `docker-compose.yml` or choose a custom name. If you use a different file name, specify it with the `-f` option in Docker Compose commands. For example, if you name your file `my-compose-file.yml`, you would run:
```bash
docker-compose -f my-compose-file.yml up
```
Custom Name: Use the  `-f`  option to specify a different file name.

This file defines your applicationâ€™s services, their configurations, volumes, and networks.The docker-compose.yml file contains :

 **Example:**
 ```bash
 
version: '3.8' # Specify the version of Docker Compose syntax to useservices:  

web:  
image: ubuntu # Use the official Ubuntu image  

command: sleep infinity # Keep the container running by using a command  

networks:  
- my_network # Connect the web service to the custom network db:  
image: mysql:5.7 # Use the official MySQL image version 5.7 
 
environment:  
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example # Set the root password for MySQL

volumes:  
- db_data:/var/lib/mysql # Persist database data using a named volume   

networks:  
- my_network # Connect the db service to the custom networknetworks:  

my_network:  
driver: bridge # Use the default bridge network drivervolumes:  
db_data: # Declare the named volume used by the db service



```

This example defines two services: `web` (an Ubuntu ) and `db` (a MySQL database). It also defines a volume `db_data` to persist the database data.


## 2\. Run the Application

	 docker-compose up 

This command builds (if necessary) and starts all containers, creating the necessary networks and volumes.

## 3\. Scale Services

Use the `docker-compose up` command to start all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

	 docker-compose up --scale web=3

This will run three instances of the  
`web` service.
## 4\. Stop and Remove Containers
To stop and remove the containers, networks, and volumes defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, use:

	 docker-compose down

This command stops all running containers and removes the resources created by `docker-compose up`.

## 5\. Viewing Logs

You can view the combined logs from all services with:

	 docker-compose logs [service_name]
