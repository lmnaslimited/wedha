## 1\. Create a `docker-compose.yml` File

This file defines your applicationâ€™s services, their configurations, volumes, and networks.

 **Example:**
 ```bash
 
	yaml 
	version: '3.8'
	services:
	  web: 
	   image: nginx:alpine
	   ports:
	     - "8080:80" 
	   volumes: 
	     - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
	  db: 
	    image: mysql:5.7 
	    environment: 
	      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
	    volumes:
	      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
	volumes: 
	   db_data:
```

This example defines two services: `web` (an Nginx server) and `db` (a MySQL database). It also defines a volume `db_data` to persist the database data.


## 2\. Run the Application

	 docker-compose up 

This command builds (if necessary) and starts all containers, creating the necessary networks and volumes.

## 3\. Scale Services

Use the `docker-compose up` command to start all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

	 docker-compose up --scale web=3

This will run three instances of the  
`web` service.
## 4\. Stop and Remove Containers
To stop and remove the containers, networks, and volumes defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, use:

	 docker -compose down

This command stops all running containers and removes the resources created by `docker-compose up`.

## 5\. Viewing Logs

You can view the combined logs from all services with:

	 docker -compose logs [service_name]
To follow the logs in real-time, use:

	docker-compose logs -f [service_name]
