**Example**
 
	bash 
	docker ps

To list all containers, including stopped ones:

    bash 
	docker ps -a

## 3\. docker build


 **Purpose**: Builds an image from a Dockerfile.
 
**Example**
 
	bash 
	docker run -it ubuntu

This command pulls the `ubuntu` image (if not already available locally) and starts a new container in interactive mode with a terminal.
