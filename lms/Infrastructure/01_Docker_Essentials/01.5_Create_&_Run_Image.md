#  Dockerfile

Before creating a Docker image for Ubuntu, you need to have Docker installed on your system.

-   **Docker :**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. If you havenâ€™t installed Docker yet, refer to Lesson 2 for installation steps.

## 1\. Create a Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a script that contains a series of commands to build a Docker image.

###  **Set Up Your Project Directory**:

Create a new directory for your Docker project and navigate to it:
 
 ```bash 
  mkdir my-ubuntu-image
  cd my-ubuntu-image
```
	

### **Create a Dockerfile**:
Inside the project directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content. You can use VS Code or an text editors like ` vi` or `nano`:

To create and open the `Dockerfile` in VS Code , use:

```bash
touch Dockerfile && code Dockerfile
```
	
This command will create the `Dockerfile` and open it in VS Code for editing.

Next, add the following content to the `Dockerfile`:

 ```bash
 # Use the official Ubuntu base image
   
FROM ubuntu ## This line specifies the base image for the Docker container. In this case, it's the official Ubuntu image.# Set environment variables (optional) 
 
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive ## This sets an environment variable to make apt-get commands run non-interactively, avoiding prompts during package installations.# Update the package list and install basic packages  

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \  

curl \ ## Installs curl, a command-line tool for transferring data with URLs.
  
vim \ ## Installs vim, a text editor.
  
git \ ## Installs git, a version control system. 
 
&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* ## Removes the package list to reduce image size.# Set the working directory  

WORKDIR /root ## Sets the working directory inside the container to /root.# Copy files from the host to the container (optional)
  
COPY . /root ## Copies all files from the current directory on the host machine to the /root directory inside the container.# Define the command to run when the container starts
  
CMD ["bash"] ## Specifies that the default command to run when the container starts is bash, which opens a terminal session.  
```	

## 2\. Build the Docker Image


###  **Build the Image from the Dockerfile**:
Use the `docker build` command to create a Docker image from your Dockerfile:

	docker build -t my-ubuntu-image .
-   The  `-t my-ubuntu-image`  flag tags the image with the name  `my-ubuntu-image`.
-   The  `.`  at the end of the command tells Docker to look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.

### **Verify the Image Creation**:

List all Docker images on your system to verify that your image was created successfully:

	
	docker images
You should see `my-ubuntu-image` listed among the images.

## 3\. **Run the Docker Container**

###  **Run the Container from the Image**:
Use the  `docker run`  command to create and start a container from your image:

	 docker run -it --name my-ubuntu-container my-ubuntu-image

-   The  `-it`  flag starts the container in interactive mode, allowing you to interact with it via the terminal.
-   The  `--name my-ubuntu-container`  option names the container  `my-ubuntu-container`.
-   `my-ubuntu-image`  specifies the image from which to create the container.

### **Verify the Container is Running**:
 
 In a new terminal window, you can check the list of running containers using:

	 docker ps

Your container should be listed, showing it is up and running.

### **Exit the Container**:

To stop and exit the container, type `exit` or press `Ctrl + D` in the container's terminal.
