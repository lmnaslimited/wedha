# Pre-Requisites

Before you begin, ensure that your system meets the following requirements:

-    **Operating System**: Ubuntu (or a derivative such as Linux Mint)
-    **User Privileges**: You should have sudo privileges to perform installations and configurations.

## 1\. **Set Up Docker's apt Repository**

Docker Engine is installed from Docker's official repository. The first step is to set up this repository.

###  **Add Docker's Official GPG Key**:

 Open a terminal and run the following commands to add Docker's GPG key, which is necessary for verifying the integrity of the Docker packages:
 
 bash  
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
 sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
 sudo curl -fsSL  [https://download.docker.com/linux/   ubuntu/gpg](https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg)  -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
 sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc


## 2\.  **Add the Docker Repository to Apt Sources**:

### Installation command
Next, add Docker's repository to your system's apt sources list:

	bash
	echo 
	"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc]  https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu 
	$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
	sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
This command configures your package manager to download Docker packages from Docker's official repository.

 **Note:**  If you're using a derivative of Ubuntu (like Linux Mint), you may need to replace  `VERSION_CODENAME`  with  `UBUNTU_CODENAME`  in the command above.

```
npm install cypress

```

Verify Cypress installation

```
npx cypress verify

```

## 3\. Open Cypress

Open a terminal or command promt and run the following commmands to open Cypress:

```
  npx cypress open

```
