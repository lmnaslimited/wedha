# Pre-Requisites

Before creating a Docker image for Ubuntu, you need to have Docker installed on your system.

-   **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. If you haven’t installed Docker yet, refer to Lesson 2 for installation steps.

## 1\. Create a Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a script that contains a series of commands to build a Docker image.

###  **Set Up Your Project Directory**:

Create a new directory for your Docker project and navigate to it:
 
    arduino
	mkdir my-ubuntu-image
	cd my-ubuntu-image
	

### **Create a Dockerfile**:
Inside the project directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:

	bash
	echo 
	"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc]  https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu 
	$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
	sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
This command configures your package manager to download Docker packages from Docker's official repository.

 >**Note:**  If you're using a derivative of Ubuntu (like Linux Mint), you may need to replace  `VERSION_CODENAME`  with  `UBUNTU_CODENAME`  in the command above.


### **Update the Package Index**:
After adding the repository, update the package index to include Docker's packages:

	bash
	sudo apt-get update


## 2\. Install Docker Engine
Now that the repository is set up, you can install Docker Engine and its associated components.

###  **Install the Latest Version of Docker Engine**:
Run the following command to install Docker Engine, Docker CLI, containerd, and the Docker Compose plugin:

	bash
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli  [containerd.io](http://containerd.io/)  docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin


### **Verify Docker Installation**:

To verify that Docker Engine has been installed correctly, run the following command:

	bash
	sudo docker run hello-world
This command downloads a test Docker image (`hello-world`) and runs it in a container. If Docker is installed correctly, you will see a message confirming that the installation was successful.

## 3\. **Install Docker Desktop (Optional)**
If you haven't already, set up Docker's apt repository by following the steps in  **Step 1**  above.

###  **Download the Latest Docker Desktop DEB Package**:
Download the latest version of the Docker Desktop package from Docker's official website  [https://desktop.docker.com/linux/main/amd64/docker-desktop-amd64.deb?utm_source=docker[…]*_ga_XJWPQMJYHQ*MTcyMzg2NzU0Ni4yLjEuMTcyMzg2Nzg3Mi40OC4wLjA](https://desktop.docker.com/linux/main/amd64/docker-desktop-amd64.deb?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs-driven-download-linux-amd64&_gl=1*htpd6r*_ga*MjQyMzUyODk1LjE3MjM4MDUyNzM.*_ga_XJWPQMJYHQ*MTcyMzg2NzU0Ni4yLjEuMTcyMzg2Nzg3Mi40OC4wLjA). or use the following command to download it:

	bash
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-<arch>.deb

> **Note:**  Replace  `<arch>`  with your system's architecture (e.g.,  `amd64`).

### **Install Docker Desktop**:

	 bash
	sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-<arch>.deb
This command will install Docker Desktop, allowing you to manage Docker through a user-friendly graphical interface.
