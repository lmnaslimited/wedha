# Pre-Requisites

Before creating a Docker image for Ubuntu, you need to have Docker installed on your system.

-   **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. If you havenâ€™t installed Docker yet, refer to Lesson 2 for installation steps.

## 1\. Create a Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a script that contains a series of commands to build a Docker image.

###  **Set Up Your Project Directory**:

Create a new directory for your Docker project and navigate to it:
 
  
	mkdir my-ubuntu-image
	cd my-ubuntu-image
	

### **Create a Dockerfile**:
Inside the project directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content. You can use VS Coan text editors like ` vi` or `nano`:

To create and open the `Dockerfile` in VS Code with a single command, use:

	touch Dockerfile && code Dockerfile
	
This command will create the `Dockerfile` and open it in VS Code for editing.

Next, add the following content to the `Dockerfile`:
	
This command will open the Dockerfile in VS code 
   and nano:

	touch Dockerfile && code Dockerfile
 ii  
	Use the official Ubuntu base image  
	FROM ubuntu  
	Set environment variables (optional)  
	ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive  
	Update the package list and install basic packages  
	RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y  
	curl  
	vim  
	git  
	&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*  
	Set the working directory  
	WORKDIR /root  
	Copy files from the host to the container (optional)  
	COPY . /root  
	Define the command to run when the container starts  
	CMD ["bash"] 
	

## 2\. Build the Docker Image


###  **Build the Image from the Dockerfile**:
Use the `docker build` command to create a Docker image from your Dockerfile:

	docker build -t my-ubuntu-image .
-   The  `-t my-ubuntu-image`  flag tags the image with the name  `my-ubuntu-image`.
-   The  `.`  at the end of the command tells Docker to look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.

### **Verify the Image Creation**:

List all Docker images on your system to verify that your image was created successfully:

	
	docker images
You should see `my-ubuntu-image` listed among the images.

## 3\. **Run the Docker Container**

###  **Run the Container from the Image**:
Use the  `docker run`  command to create and start a container from your image:

	 docker run -it --name my-ubuntu-container my-ubuntu-image

-   The  `-it`  flag starts the container in interactive mode, allowing you to interact with it via the terminal.
-   The  `--name my-ubuntu-container`  option names the container  `my-ubuntu-container`.
-   `my-ubuntu-image`  specifies the image from which to create the container.

### **Verify the Container is Running**:
 
 In a new terminal window, you can check the list of running containers using:

	 docker ps

Your container should be listed, showing it is up and running.

### **Exit the Container**:

To stop and exit the container, type `exit` or press `Ctrl + D` in the container's terminal.
