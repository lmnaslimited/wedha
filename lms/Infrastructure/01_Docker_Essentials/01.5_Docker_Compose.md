# **What is Docker?**

Docker is a popular open-source platform that automates the process of building, shipping, and running applications using containerization. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that include everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Docker simplifies the deployment of applications across different environments by ensuring consistency and isolating applications from their host system. This approach streamlines development workflows and enhances scalability and flexibility.

# **Features**

### Containerization:

 Docker packages applications and their dependencies into isolated containers, which can run consistently on any environmentâ€”development, testing, or production. This eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem and simplifies application deployment.

### Portability:

Docker containers can be deployed on various platforms, including local machines, cloud environments, and virtual machines, without modification. This ensures that applications behave the same way regardless of where they are run.

### Version Control:
Docker allows you to version control your containers using Docker images. You can create, share, and roll back to different versions of your containers, providing flexibility in managing application releases.

### Resource Efficiency:
Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight and resource-efficient compared to traditional virtual machines. This allows you to run more containers on the same hardware.

### Scalability:
Docker supports scaling applications horizontally by running multiple container instances. This makes it easy to handle increased traffic and load by simply adding more containers.

### Isolation:
Containers run in isolated environments, ensuring that each application or service does not interfere with others. This isolation improves security and stability.

### Ease of Use:
Docker provides a simple command-line interface and graphical tools for managing containers, making it accessible for both developers and system administrators.
