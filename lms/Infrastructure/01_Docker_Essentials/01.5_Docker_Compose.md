# **What is Docker Com?**

Docker is a popular open-source platform that automates the process of building, shipping, and running applications using containerization. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that include everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Docker simplifies the deployment of applications across different environments by ensuring consistency and isolating applications from their host system. This approach streamlines development workflows and enhances scalability and flexibility.

# **Features**

### Containerization:

 Docker packages applications and their dependencies into isolated containers, which can run consistently on any environment—development, testing, or production. This eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem and simplifies application deployment.

### Portability:

Docker containers can be deployed on various platforms, including local machines, cloud environments, and virtual machines, without modification. This ensures that applications behave the same way regardless of where they are runPre-Requisites

Before creating a Docker image for Ubuntu, you need to have Docker installed on your system.

-   **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine. If you haven’t installed Docker yet, refer to Lesson 2 for installation steps.

## 1\. Create a Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a script that contains a series of commands to build a Docker image.

###  **Set Up Your Project Directory**:

Create a new directory for your Docker project and navigate to it:
 
  
	mkdir my-ubuntu-image
	cd my-ubuntu-image
	

### **Create a Dockerfile**:
Inside the project directory, create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content. You can use VS Coan text editors like ` vi` or `nano`:

To create and open the `Dockerfile` in VS Code , use:

	touch Dockerfile && code Dockerfile
	
This command will create the `Dockerfile` and open it in VS Code for editing.

Next, add the following content to the `Dockerfile`:
	 and nano:

	touch Dockerfile && code Dockerfile
 ii  
	Use the official Ubuntu base image  
	FROM ubuntu  
	Set environment variables (optional)  
	ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive  
	Update the package list and install basic packages  
	RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y  
	curl  
	vim  
	git  
	&& rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*  
	Set the working directory  
	WORKDIR /root  
	Copy files from the host to the container (optional)  
	COPY . /root  
	Define the command to run when the container starts  
	CMD ["bash"] 
	

## 2\. Build the Docker Image


###  **Build the Image from the Dockerfile**:
Use the `docker build` command to create a Docker image from your Dockerfile:

	docker build -t my-ubuntu-image .
-   The  `-t my-ubuntu-image`  flag tags the image with the name  `my-ubuntu-image`.
-   The  `.`  at the end of the command tells Docker to look for the Dockerfile in the current directory.

### **Version Control:
Docker allows you to version control your containers using Docker images. You canify the Image Creation**:

List all Docker images on your system to verify that your image was create,d share, and roll back to different versions of your containers, providing flexibility in managing application releases.

### Resource Efficiency:
Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight and resource-efficient compared to traditional virtual machines. This allows you to run more containers on the same hardware.

### Scalability:
Docker supports scaling applications horizontally by running multiple container instances. This makes it easy to handle increased traffic and load by simply adding moruccessfully:

	
	docker images
You should see `my-ubuntu-image` listed among the images.

## 3\. **Run the Docker Container**

###  **Run the Container from the Image**:
Use the  `docker run`  command to create and start a container from your image:

	 docker run -it --name my-ubuntu-container my-ubuntu-image

-   The  `-it`  flag starts the container in interactive mode, allowing you to interact with it via the terminal.
-   The  `--name my-ubuntu-container`  option names the container  `my-ubuntu-container`.
-   `my-ubuntu-image`  specifies the image from which to create the containers.

### Isolation:
**Verify the Container is rRun nin isolated environments, ensuring that each application or service does not g**:
 
 In a new terminal window, you can check the list of running containers using:

	 docker ps

Your containterfere with others. This isolation improves security and stability.

### Ease of Use:
Docker provides a simple command-line interface and graphical tools for managing should be listed, showing it is up and running.

### **Exit the Container**:

To stop and exit the containers, making it accessible for both developers and system administrators.

type `exit` or press `Ctrl + D` in the container's terminal.
