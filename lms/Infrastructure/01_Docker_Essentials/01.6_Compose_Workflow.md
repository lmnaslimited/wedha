## 1\. Create a `docker-compose.yml` File

This file defines your applicationâ€™s services, their configurations, volumes, and networks.

 ** Example**:
  
	yaml 
	version: '3.8'
	services:
	  web: 
	   image: nginx:alpine
	   ports:
	     - "8080:80" 
	   volumes: 
	     - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
	  db: 
	    image: mysql:5.7 
	    environment: 
	      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
	    volumes:
	      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql
	volumes: 
	   db_data:

This example defines two services: `web` (an Nginx server) and `db` (a MySQL database). It also defines a volume `db_data` to persist the database data.


## 2\. Run the Application

Use the `docker-compose up` command to start all the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

	docker -compose up

This command builds (if necessary) and starts all containers, creating the necessary networks and volumes.

## 2\. Run the Ap

	docker -compose up

This command builds (if necessary) and starts all containers, creating the necessary networks and volumes.
