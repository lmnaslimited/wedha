# **What is Docker?**

Docker is a ool that helps eoers pacage applications so they can runtool that helps developers package applications so they can run consistently on any system. It simplifies the process of setting up, testing, and deploying software, making it easier to move applications from development to production.

# **Features**

### Containerization:

 Docker packages applications and their dependencies into isolated containers, which can run consistently on any environmentâ€”development, testing, or production. This eliminates the "it works on my machine" problemation deploymenton an system.

### Portability:

Docker containers can be deployed on various platforms, including local machines, cloud environments, and virtual machines, without modification. This ensures that applications behave the same way regardless of where they are run.

### Version Control:
Docker allows you to version control your containers using Docker images. You can create, share, and roll back to different versions of your containers, providing flexibility in managing application releases.

### Resource Efficiency:
Containers share the host OS kernel, making them more lightweight and resource-efficient compared to traditional virtual machines. This allows you to run more containers on the same hardware.

### Scalability:
Docker supports scaling applications horizontally by running multiple container instances. This makes it easy to handle increased traffic and load by simply adding more containers.

### Isolation:
Containers run in isolated environments, ensuring that each application or service does not interfere with others. This isolation improves security and stability.

### Ease of Use:
Docker provides a simple command-line interface and graphical tools for managing containers, making it accessible for both developers and system administrators.
