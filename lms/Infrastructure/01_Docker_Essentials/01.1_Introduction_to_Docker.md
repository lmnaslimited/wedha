# **What is Docker?**

Docker is a popular open-source platform that automates the process of building, shipping, and running applications using containerization. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that include everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies. Docker simplifies the deployment of applications across different environments by ensuring consistency and isolating applications from their host system. This approach streamlines development workflows and enhances scalability and flexibility.

# **Features**

### Containerization:

 Docker packages applications and their dependencies into isolated containers, which can run consistently on any environment—development, testing, or production. This eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem and simplifies application deployment.

### Portability:

Docker containers can be deployed on various platforms, including local machines, cloud environments, and virtual machines, without modification. This ensures that applications behave the same way regardless of where they are run.

### Version Control:

Cypress provides a real-time preview of your application and the tests running against it. This helps you see exactly what’s happening during test execution.

### Automatic Waiting:

Cypress automatically waits for elements to appear, animations to  
complete, and XHR requests to finish, reducing the need for manual wait commands.

### Cypress supports various types of testing:

-   End-to-End (E2E) Testing.
-   Integration Testing.
-   Unit Testing.
-   API Testing.
