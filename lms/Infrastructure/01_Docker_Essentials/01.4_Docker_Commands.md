# Docker Commands

This command is used to run a container from an image. The docker run command is a combination of the docker create and docker start commands. It creates a new container from the image specified and starts that container. if the docker image is not present, then the docker run pulls that.

$ docker run <image_name>  
To give name of container  
$ docker run --name <container_name> <image_name>

### **Docker Pull**
This command allows you to pull any image which is present in the official registry of docker,Docker hub.By default, it pulls the latest image, but you can also mention the version of the image.
$ docker pull <image_name>

### **Docker PS**
This command (by default) shows us a list of all the running containers. We can use various flags with it.

-   **-a flag:** shows us all the containers, stopped or running.
-   **-l flag:** shows us the latest container.
-   **-q flag**: shows only the Id of the containers.

$ docker ps [options..]

Suppose you want to start the stopped container again, you can do it with the help of this command.

$ docker start <container_ID>  
  
  
  

### ****Docker rm****

Some important flags:

-   ****-f flag:**** remove the container forcefully.
