# Pre-Requisites

Before installing Portainer, ensure that Docker is already installed on your system. Portainer will be run as a Docker container, so having Docker set up correctly is essential.

## 1\. Install Docker 

If Docker is not installed on your system, you can follow the installation instructions for Docker on Ubuntu. If Docker is already installed, you can skip this step.

###  **Verify Docker Installation**:

To verify that Docker is installed correctly, open a terminal and run the following commands:
 ```bash
  docker --version 
  docker info
```

## 2\. Pull the Portainer Docker Image
Portainer is available as a Docker image, which can be pulled from Docker Hub. This step will download the Portainer image to your system.

###  **Pull the Portainer Image**:
Open a terminal and run the following command to pull the Portainer image:

```bash
 docker pull portainer/portainer-ce
 ```


## 3\. Create and Run the Portainer Container
Once the Portainer image is downloaded, you can create and run the Portainer container. This container will provide a web-based UI for managing your Docker environment.

###  **Run the Portainer Container**:
Execute the following command in your terminal:

``` bash
 docker run -d \
  -p 9000:9000 \ 
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \ -v portainer_data:/data \ 
  --name portainer \
   portainer/portainer-ce
```

> **Note:**  Replace  `<arch>`  with your system's architecture (e.g.,  `amd64`).

### **Install Docker Desktop**:

```bash
 sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-<arch>.deb
```
This command will install Docker Desktop, allowing you to manage Docker through a user-friendly graphical interface.
