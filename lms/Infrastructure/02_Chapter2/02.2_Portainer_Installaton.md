# Pre-Requisites

Before installing Portainer, ensure that Docker is already installed on your system. Portainer will be run as a Docker container, so having Docker set up correctly is essential.

## 1\. Install Docker 

If Docker is not installed on your system, you can follow the installation instructions for Docker on Ubuntu. If Docker is already installed, you can skip this step.

###  **Verify Docker Installation**:

To verify that Docker is installed correctly, open a terminal and run the following commands:
 ```bash
  docker --version 
  docker info
```

## 2\. Pull the Portainer Docker Image
Portainer is available as a Docker image, which can be pulled from Docker Hub. This step will download the Portainer image to your system.

###  **Pull the Portainer Image**:
Open a terminal and run the following command to pull the Portainer image:

```bash
 docker pull portainer/portainer-ce
 ```


## 3\. Create and Run the Portainer Container
If you haven't already, set up Docker's apt repository by following the steps in  **Step 1**  above.

###  **Download the Latest Docker Desktop DEB Package**:
Download the latest version of the Docker Desktop package from Docker's official website  [https://desktop.docker.com/linux/main/amd64/docker-desktop-amd64.deb?utm_source=docker[â€¦]*_ga_XJWPQMJYHQ*MTcyMzg2NzU0Ni4yLjEuMTcyMzg2Nzg3Mi40OC4wLjA](https://desktop.docker.com/linux/main/amd64/docker-desktop-amd64.deb?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=docs-driven-download-linux-amd64&_gl=1*htpd6r*_ga*MjQyMzUyODk1LjE3MjM4MDUyNzM.*_ga_XJWPQMJYHQ*MTcyMzg2NzU0Ni4yLjEuMTcyMzg2Nzg3Mi40OC4wLjA). or use the following command to download it:

``` bash
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-<arch>.deb
```

> **Note:**  Replace  `<arch>`  with your system's architecture (e.g.,  `amd64`).

### **Install Docker Desktop**:

```bash
 sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-<arch>.deb
```
This command will install Docker Desktop, allowing you to manage Docker through a user-friendly graphical interface.
