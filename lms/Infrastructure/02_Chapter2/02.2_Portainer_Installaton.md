# Pre-Requisites

Before installing Portainer, ensure that Docker is already installed on your system. Portainer will be run as a Docker container, so having Docker set up correctly is essential.

## 1\. Install Docker 

If Docker is not installed on your system, you can follow the installation instructions for Docker on Ubuntu. If Docker is already installed, you can skip this step.

###  **Verify Docker Installation**:

To verify that Docker is installed correctly, open a terminal and run the following commands:
 ```bash
  docker --version 
  docker info
```

## 2\. Pull the Portainer Docker Image
Portainer is available as a Docker image, which can be pulled from Docker Hub. This step will download the Portainer image to your system.

###  **Pull the Portainer Image**:
Open a terminal and run the following command to pull the Portainer image:

```bash
 docker pull portainer/portainer-ce
 ```


## 3\. Create and Run the Portainer Container
Once the Portainer image is downloaded, you can create and run the Portainer container. This container will provide a web-based UI for managing your Docker environment.

###  **Run the Portainer Container**:
Execute the following command in your terminal:

```
docker run -d \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v portainer_data:/data \
  --name portainer \
  portainer/portainer-ce



```
-   `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
-   `-p 9000:9000`: Maps port 9000 on your host to port 9000 in the container, allowing access to the Portainer UI.
-   `-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`: Mounts the Docker socket so Portainer can interact with the Docker daemon.
-   `-v portainer_data:/data`: Creates a named volume to persist Portainer data.
-   `--name portainer`: Names the container  `portainer`.

## 4\. Access the Portainer UI
Once the container is running, you can access the Portainer UI via a web browser.

###  **Open the Portainer UI**:
Execute the following command in your terminal:

Navigate to the following URL:
-   `[http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/)`  (if you are running Portainer locally)
-   `http://<your-server-ip>:9000`  (if you are running Portainer on a remote server)

## 5\. Set Up Portainer 

When you first access Portainer, you'll be prompted to create an admin user account.
### **Create an Admin User**:

-   Enter a username and password of your choice.
-   This will secure your Portainer instance, ensuring only authorized users can manage your Docker environment.

## 6\. Connect Portainer to Your Docker Environment

After setting up your admin account, you'll be asked to connect Portainer to your Docker environment.
### **Connect to Docker**:

-   **Default Option**: Portainer will automatically connect to the local Docker instance (Docker Socket). Select this option if Docker is installed on the same host.
-   Follow any additional prompts to complete the setup.
