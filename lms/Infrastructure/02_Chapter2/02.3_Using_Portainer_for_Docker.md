# Portainer Docker Mastery

In this lesson, we'll dive into using Portainer to manage your Docker environment effectively. You'll learn how to utilize Portainer's web-based interface to perform essential Docker management tasks without relying solely on the command line.

**Section 1: Accessing the Portainer Dashboard**  

-   **Objective**: Understand how to access the Portainer dashboard to manage your Docker containers, images, volumes, and networks.


-   Open your web browser and navigate to  `[http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/)`  or the IP address where Portainer is running.
	-   Log in with the admin credentials you set up during installation.
	-   Explore the dashboard, which provides an overview of your Docker environment, including running containers, available images, and system metrics.

**Section 2: Managing Docker Containers**  

-   **Objective**: Learn how to create, start, stop, and remove Docker containers using Portainer.

-   **Creating a Container**:

	-   Navigate to the "Containers" section in the Portainer dashboard.
	-   Click "Add Container" to create a new container.
	-   Provide a name, select an image from Docker Hub or your local repository, and configure the necessary settings (e.g., ports, volumes, environment variables).

	-   Click "Deploy the container" to launch it.

-   **Starting and Stopping Containers**:

	-   View your running and stopped containers in the "Containers" section.

	-   Use the "Start," "Stop," or "Restart" buttons to control the state of each container.

-   **Removing Containers**:

	-   Select a container and click "Remove" to delete it from your Docker environment.

**Section 3: Managing Docker Images**  

-   **Objective**: Understand how to pull, push, and manage Docker images within Portainer.

-   **Pulling Images**:

	-   Go to the "Images" section in Portainer.

	-   Enter the name of an image in the "Image" field and click "Pull the image" to download it from Docker Hub.

-   **Pushing Images**:

	-   After building a custom image locally, push it to your Docker Hub repository via the Portainer interface.

-   **Managing Local Images**:

	-   View all your locally stored images, remove unused images to free up space, or tag images for version control.

**Section 4: Managing Docker Volumes**  

-   **Objective**: Learn how to create, inspect, and manage Docker volumes using Portainer.

-   **Creating a Volume**:

	-   Navigate to the "Volumes" section and click "Add Volume."

	-   Provide a name for the volume and click "Create the volume."

-   **Inspecting Volumes**:

	-   View details about each volume, such as size, mount points, and the containers using it.

-   **Removing Volumes**:

	-   Select and remove unused volumes to reclaim disk space.

**Section 5: Managing Docker Networks**  

-   **Objective**: Understand how to create and manage Docker networks through Portainer.

-   **Creating a Network**:

	-   In the "Networks" section, click "Add Network."

	-   Choose the network type (e.g., bridge, overlay) and provide a name before clicking "Create the network."

-   **Connecting Containers to Networks**:

	-   When deploying or updating a container, select the appropriate network from the dropdown list to connect it.

-   **Inspecting and Removing Networks**:

	-   View network details, including connected containers, and remove unused networks.

**Section 6: Monitoring and Logs**  

-   **Objective**: Utilize Portainer to monitor container performance and access logs.

-   **Viewing Logs**:

	-   Select a container and click "Logs" to view real-time or historical logs, which are essential for troubleshooting and monitoring application performance.

-   **Monitoring Container Metrics**:

	-   Use the Portainer dashboard to monitor CPU, memory, and network usage for each container.
