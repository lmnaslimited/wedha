**Practice 1**

**Objective:**: Learn how to deploy the Lens Image Stack using Portainer.

**Steps**:

**1. Access the Portainer Dashboard**

Open your web browser and navigate to the Portainer dashboard (usually accessible at `http://localhost:9000` or your server's IP address).

**2. Create a New Stack**

 In the Portainer dashboard, navigate to the "Stacks" section.
 Click on "Add Stack" to create a new stack for your Lens Image deployment.

**3. Define the Stack Configuration**

 In the stack creation form, enter a name for your stack (e.g., "Lens-Image-Stack").
In the "Web editor" section, input the necessary Docker Compose configuration to deploy the Lens Image Stack. Here is a basic example:
```bash  
#yaml
version: '3.8' 
services: 
   lens: 
     image: ghcr.io/lensapp/lens:latest
     ports:
        - "3000:3000" 
     volumes:
        - lens-data:/var/lib/lens
     networks: 
        - lens-network 
volumes: 
   lens-data:
networks: 
   lens-network:
```
 
**4. Deploy the Stack**

After entering the configuration, scroll down and click "Deploy the stack" to initiate the deployment process.

**5. Verify the Deployment**

 Once deployed, navigate to the "Containers" section in Portainer to ensure that the Lens container is running.
Access the Lens application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` or your server's IP address with port 3000 in your browser.

**Expected Outcome**:  
-   The Lens Image Stack should be successfully deployed and accessible via the specified port.
-   You should be able to manage and interact with the Lens application through the Portainer dashboard.
