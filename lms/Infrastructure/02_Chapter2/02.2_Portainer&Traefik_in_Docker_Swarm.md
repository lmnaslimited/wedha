# **What is Portainer and Traefik?**
- **Portainer** is a lightweight management UI that allows you to manage Docker environments, including Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and standalone Docker instances.

- **Traefik** is a reverse proxy and load balancer that simplifies routing to your Docker containers and services. It integrates with Docker Swarm to automatically manage routing of traffic to the right services.


#  Components of Portainer

- **Portainer Server**: The core service that provides the UI and APIs for managing Docker.

- **Portainer Agent**: A service that allows the Portainer Server to communicate with Docker Swarm nodes and standalone Docker instances.
