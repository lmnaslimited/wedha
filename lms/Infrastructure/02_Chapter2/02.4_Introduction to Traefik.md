 # What is Traefik ? 
- **Traefik** is an open-source Edge Router that takes care of all the networking complexities attached to modern and distributed software architectures. It is often referred to as a reverse proxy and a load balancer.
- The primary purpose of Traefik is to route requests in your system to the appropriate microservices. It does this dynamically, meaning it can automatically discover and manage the routing to new services as they are added to your architecture. This makes Traefik particularly well-suited to environments where services are frequently scaling up and down, or being deployed and taken down, such as in cloud-hosted applications.
## How Traefik Works

- In simple words, Traefik operates as an intermediary between your users and your services. When a user sends a request to your website/application, Traefik receives that request and determines where to route it based on the rules you’ve set. This process is similar to how a traffic cop directs cars at an intersection, ensuring that each request reaches the correct destination.
- In environments where services are frequently changing, such as when new applications are being added or old ones are being removed, Traefik shines. It has the ability to automatically detect these changes and adjust its routing rules accordingly. This means that as you add or remove services, Traefik seamlessly updates its routing without any manual intervention.
- Traefik also handles the encryption of your users’ data. When a user connects to your website/application, their connection can be encrypted using SSL/TLS, ensuring that their data is secure as it travels over the internet. Traefik manages this encryption process automatically, obtaining and renewing the necessary certificates as needed. This ensures that your website/application remains secure, even as technologies and standards evolve.
# The base concepts of Traefik
1.  [EntryPoints](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/entrypoints/ "Link to docs about EntryPoints"): EntryPoints are the network entry points into Traefik. They define the port which will receive the packets, and whether to listen for TCP or UDP.
    
2.  [Routers](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/routers/ "Link to docs about routers"): A router is in charge of connecting incoming requests to the services that can handle them.
    
3.  [Middlewares](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/overview/ "Link to docs about middlewares"): Attached to the routers, middlewares can modify the requests or responses before they are sent to your service
    
4.  [Services](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/services/ "Link to docs about services"): Services are responsible for configuring how to reach the actual services that will eventually handle the incoming requests.

**Key Features of Traefik** 
Traefik offers a wide range of features that make it a powerful and flexible tool for managing network traffic in modern, distributed systems. Here are some of the key features that set Traefik apart from other server software:

-  **Service Discovery**: -   Traefik automatically detects and manages routing to new services as they are added to your architecture, integrating seamlessly with popular service discovery mechanisms like Docker, Kubernetes, and Rancher. This dynamic configuration and hot-reloading capability make it particularly well-suited to environments where services are frequently scaling up and down, or being deployed and taken down.
-   **Routing**: Traefik uses the Host information and the path of incoming requests to determine where to route them. You can define routing rules in Traefik’s configuration, and these rules can be as simple or complex as needed. Traefik supports a variety of matchers for requests, including path-based, header-based, and method-based matchers.
-   **Load Balancing**: Traefik provides efficient load balancing to handle traffic to your services, distributing incoming requests across multiple instances of a service. This helps to ensure that no single instance becomes a bottleneck, improving the overall performance of your applications. Traefik supports several load balancing algorithms, including round robin, least connections, and others.
-   **Middleware**: Traefik introduces the concept of middleware, which allows users to customize the request processing pipeline. Middleware can be used to manipulate the request or the response, for tasks like rate limiting, authentication, circuit breakers, and more.
-   **SSL/TLS Termination**: Traefik can handle SSL/TLS termination, meaning it can accept encrypted traffic, decrypt it, and forward it to your services as unencrypted traffic. This offloads the task of handling encryption from your services. Traefik can also automatically obtain and renew SSL/TLS certificates from Let’s Encrypt.
-   **Metrics and Tracing**: Traefik provides metrics for various systems like Prometheus and Datadog, and supports distributed tracing with systems like Jaeger and Zipkin. This makes it easier to monitor and troubleshoot your applications.
-   **Multiple Backend Support**: Traefik supports a variety of backends including Docker, Kubernetes, Swarm, Rancher, and many others. This makes it a versatile tool that can be used in a wide range of environments.
-   **Protocol Support**: Traefik supports modern protocols like HTTP/2, HTTP/3 and WebSockets, allowing you to take advantage of these technologies in your applications.
# Traefik Dashboard
Traefik comes with a handy dashboard that provides a detailed overview of the current status of your cluster.

This includes all the current routes being handled by the cluster, but also its status and license information.
