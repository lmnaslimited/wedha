This lesson focuses on how to protect applications from common vulnerabilities by covering practical techniques like validating user input, configuring security settings, using strong authentication, and basic monitoring, leaving detailed secure coding practices for a later lesson.



## 1. **Preventing SQL Injection**

SQL injection occurs when an attacker tricks the database into running harmful queries by manipulating user inputs. While secure coding practices can help prevent this (covered in a later lesson), here are some configuration and validation techniques to stop SQL injection attacks:

### Prevention Techniques:

-   **Input Validation:** Ensure that any data coming from users (e.g., search terms, form submissions) is validated or sanitized to block harmful inputs. This means only accepting data in the expected format (e.g., allowing only numbers or letters when needed).
    
    **Example:** For a field that asks for a user’s name, ensure that it only accepts alphabetic characters, not special symbols that could be used to inject code.
    
-   **Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries:** Configure your application to treat user input as data rather than executable code. This is often done through prepared statements, where input values are passed to the query separately from the actual SQL command.
    



## 2. **Preventing Broken Authentication**

Authentication failures can let attackers steal someone’s login credentials. While building secure login processes is part of secure coding, some critical configuration techniques can help prevent broken authentication attacks:

### Prevention Techniques:

-   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Add an extra layer of security by requiring users to verify their identity using a second factor (like a code sent to their phone). This ensures that even if an attacker steals someone’s password, they still can’t log in without access to the second factor.
    
-   **Account Lockout Mechanism:** Prevent brute force attacks by locking an account after a certain number of failed login attempts. This helps to stop attackers from repeatedly guessing passwords.
    
-   **Session Management Configuration:** Ensure that sessions are securely configured by setting reasonable session timeouts and invalidating sessions after a user logs out. This ensures that if a user leaves their account logged in, others cannot exploit it.
    


## 3. **Preventing Security Misconfiguration**

Misconfiguration happens when application settings leave doors open for attackers. Here's how to prevent this:

### Prevention Techniques:

-   **Change Default Settings:** Always replace default usernames, passwords, and other configurations that come with the software. Default settings are well-known to attackers, making them easy targets.
    
    **Example:** Change the default "admin/admin123" login credentials for a web application to something unique and secure.
    
-   **Update and Patch Regularly:** Make sure that all software, frameworks, and libraries are updated regularly. Outdated systems can have known vulnerabilities that attackers can easily exploit.
    
-   **Disable Unnecessary Services or Features:** If your application comes with optional features that you don't need (e.g., file uploads, unused ports), disable them to minimize the number of potential entry points for attackers.
    


## 4. **Preventing Brute Force Attacks**

Brute force attacks involve attackers trying multiple password combinations to guess the right one. While coding plays a role here, these prevention techniques focus on configuration:

### Prevention Techniques:

-   **Set Login Limits:** Configure the system to limit how many times a user can try logging in within a certain period. If someone exceeds that limit, temporarily lock their account or increase the waiting time between attempts.
    
    **Example:** If a user enters the wrong password five times in a row, the account is locked for 15 minutes.
    
-   **Use CAPTCHA:** After several failed login attempts, introduce CAPTCHA challenges to verify that a human (not a bot) is attempting to log in.
    
-   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce policies that require users to create complex passwords with a mix of characters, numbers, and symbols. This makes it harder for attackers to guess passwords.

## 5. **Basic Security Monitoring**

Monitoring your application for unusual activity helps detect potential attacks early and respond quickly.

### Monitoring Techniques:

-   **Activity Logs and Alerts:** Log all important user activities, like login attempts, changes to account settings, and failed attempts to access restricted areas. Set up alerts for suspicious activity, such as multiple failed login attempts or attempts to access restricted files.
    
-   **Security Scans:** Run regular security scans of your application to detect vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and outdated software.
    
    **Example:** Use automated tools to check for open ports, outdated libraries, or other weaknesses that attackers could exploit.
    
-   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Implement IDS tools to detect unauthorized access or unusual patterns of behavior in your application or network.
