# **Introduction**

In today’s digital world, applications are a core part of how we communicate, work, and access services. However, these applications can become targets for hackers if they are not built securely. This lesson introduces the basics of application security, focusing on common vulnerabilities and why securing applications is so important.


## Why is Application Security Important?

Applications often handle sensitive information, like personal details or payment data. If these applications aren’t protected, attackers can exploit weaknesses to steal or damage data. Security issues usually arise because of weak coding practices, which make applications vulnerable. This is why developers need to focus on secure development from the very beginning.

## **Common Vulnerabilities**

### **1. SQL Injection**

Imagine you have a website where users can search for products. The search box sends queries to a database, like asking for all the products that match a keyword. However, if this feature isn't coded securely, an attacker could type harmful code instead of a search term, tricking the database into doing something it shouldn’t—like revealing all the users’ personal data instead of just showing product results.

**Example:**

-   **Normal input:** "laptop"
    
-   **Harmful input (SQL injection):** "laptop' OR '1'='1"
    

This code could force the database to return all data, not just laptops. A secure app would filter or validate the input to prevent this from happening.


###  2. **Broken Authentication**

Authentication is how an application checks if someone is allowed to access certain areas, like when you log into your email. If this system is weak (for example, if it doesn't lock accounts after too many failed attempts or allows easy-to-guess passwords), attackers can steal your identity and access your account.

**Example:**

An attacker could guess a user’s weak password (e.g., "password123"). Without extra protection like two-factor authentication (a text message or email verification), the hacker could log in and steal sensitive information, such as bank details.


### 3. **Security Misconfiguration**

Sometimes applications are installed with default settings that are too open or insecure. For example, if a website admin forgets to remove default passwords or doesn’t update the software regularly, attackers can exploit these weaknesses.

**Example:**

A company might forget to change the default password "admin123" that comes with their website software. If an attacker knows this, they could log in as the administrator and take over the website.


###  4. **Brute Force Attacks**

In a brute force attack, hackers use automated tools to **repeatedly** try different password combinations until they find the correct one. Without limits on login attempts or strong password requirements, this can be an easy way for hackers to break into accounts.

**Example:**

Imagine a hacker trying every possible password combination on an account—like typing "0000", then "0001", then "0002", and so on—until they guess correctly. If the application doesn’t limit the number of tries or require complex passwords, the hacker will eventually succeed.
