This lesson focus on the best practices for writing secure applications. You’ll learn how to sanitize user input, handle errors securely, and store sensitive data to protect against breaches. Following these practices will help you build applications that are more resilient to attacks.



## **1. Sanitizing User Input**

Sanitizing user input means checking and cleaning the data that comes from users before you use it. This step is crucial to prevent attacks where bad users send harmful information.

### Key Points:

-   **Check Input:** Always ensure the data matches what you expect. For example, if you ask for a phone number, only allow digits.
    
    **Example:** If someone is filling out a form, ensure that a name only contains letters.
    
-   **Clean Up Input:** Remove or change any harmful characters that could be used to attack your application.
    
    **Example:** If someone tries to enter `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, your app should change it to `&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;` so it can't run as code.
    
-   **Allow Only Safe Input:** Instead of blocking bad input, allow only what you want. If a username should only have letters and numbers, reject anything else.
    


## 2. **Managing Errors Securely**

When something goes wrong, how you handle the error matters. If you show detailed error messages, attackers might learn secrets about your application.

### Key Points:

-   **Show General Messages:** When an error happens, tell users something simple like "An error occurred. Please try again" without giving away details.
    
-   **Keep Logs Private:** Write down detailed error messages in your system logs but don’t display them to users. This way, you can fix issues without exposing sensitive information.
    
-   **Handle Errors Gracefully:** Ensure that your app continues to work well even when errors happen. For example, if a file fails to upload, let the user know without crashing the whole app.


## 3. **Storing Data Securely**

How you save sensitive information, like passwords, is crucial. If you store them poorly, they can be stolen easily.

### Key Points:

-   **Hash Passwords:** Never save passwords as plain text. Instead, change them into a scrambled format using a method called hashing.
    
    **Example:** When someone creates a password, convert it into a mix of letters and numbers that can't be reversed back to the original password.
    
-   **Add a Salt:** To make passwords even safer, add random data (called a "salt") before hashing them. This way, even if two people have the same password, their stored data looks different.
    
-   **Encrypt Sensitive Data:** For important information like credit card numbers, use strong encryption to protect it. This means even if someone steals the data, they can’t read it without a special key.
 

## 4. **Handling Sessions Securely**

When users log in, they start a session to keep track of their activity. It's important to manage these sessions securely.

### Key Points:

-   **Use Secure Cookies:** Mark cookies (small pieces of data stored on users' devices) as "Secure" to prevent them from being stolen through attacks.
    
-   **Expire Sessions:** Automatically log users out after a period of inactivity. This helps protect their accounts if they forget to log out.
    
-   **Regenerate Session IDs:** Change the session ID after a user logs in. This makes it harder for attackers to hijack a session.


## 5. **Avoiding Hardcoded Secrets**

Don’t write sensitive information (like passwords or keys) directly in your code. If someone accesses your code, they can steal these secrets.

### Key Points:

-   **Use Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information outside your code in a safe place called environment variables. This keeps them hidden.
    
    **Example:** Instead of putting your database password directly in your code, use an environment variable to store it securely.
    
-   **Secrets Management Tools:** Use tools designed to keep sensitive data safe. These tools help manage and store your secrets securely.
   

## 6. **Avoiding Common Pitfalls**

There are a few mistakes to watch out for when coding securely:

-   **Don’t Rely on Client-Side Security:** Always validate data on the server side, not just in the browser. Attackers can bypass client-side checks.
    
-   **Limit User Permissions:** Give users only the access they need. Don’t let them change things they shouldn’t.
    
-   **Keep Libraries Updated:** Regularly update any third-party tools or libraries you use. Older versions may have known weaknesses that attackers can exploit.
