### **1. What is the primary function of a DNS (Domain Name System)?**

a) To assign MAC addresses to devices  
b) To translate domain names into IP addresses  
c) To assign private IP addresses within a local network  
d) To create encrypted network connections

**Answer:** b) To translate domain names into IP addresses



### **2. Which of the following is true about MAC addresses?**

a) MAC addresses change every time a device connects to a different network  
b) MAC addresses are assigned by the Internet Service Provider (ISP)  
c) MAC addresses are unique identifiers hardcoded into the device's network interface card (NIC)  
d) MAC addresses are used for global communication across the internet

**Answer:** c) MAC addresses are unique identifiers hardcoded into the device's network interface card (NIC)



### **3. What distinguishes a private IP address from a public IP address?**

a) Private IP addresses are used only for devices within a local network, while public IP addresses are globally unique and assigned by ISPs  
b) Private IP addresses are assigned by DNS servers, while public IP addresses are assigned by MAC addresses  
c) Private IP addresses are used for internet communication, while public IP addresses are for local communication  
d) Private IP addresses never change, while public IP addresses change every time a device connects to the network

**Answer:** a) Private IP addresses are used only for devices within a local network, while public IP addresses are globally unique and assigned by ISPs

### **4. What is the main risk of connecting to a fake Wi-Fi network created by an attacker?**
