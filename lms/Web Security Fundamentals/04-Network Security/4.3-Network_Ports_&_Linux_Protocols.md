# **What Are Network Ports?**

**Network ports** are like doors on a computer or server that allow different types of data to enter and exit. Each port has a unique number, and they help manage communication between devices over a network.

## **How Ports Work**: 
When a device sends data, it includes the port number in the message. This number tells the receiving device which application or service should handle the incoming data. For example, when you visit a website, your web browser uses port 80 (for HTTP) or port 443 (for HTTPS) to connect to the server hosting that website.

 ##  Common Port Numbers
    
-   **HTTP (Port 80)**: `http://20` - Used for regular web traffic, allowing browsers to access standard websites.
    
-   **HTTPS (Port 443)**: `https://443` - Used for secure web traffic, ensuring encrypted data exchange between your browser and the website.
    
-   **FTP (Port 21)**: `ftp://21` - Used for File Transfer Protocol, facilitating file transfers between computers over a network.
    
-   **SSH (Port 22)**: `ssh://22` - Provides a secure method for remote access to another computer over a network.
    


## **Why Are Ports Important for Network Security?**

Understanding network ports is essential for maintaining security:

1.  **Controlling Access**: Network administrators can block or allow traffic on specific ports to protect their networks. For example, if a port is known for security vulnerabilities, it can be closed to prevent unauthorized access.
    
2.  **Identifying Threats**: Monitoring traffic on different ports helps identify unusual activity. If a device tries to access a blocked port, it might indicate a security threat or an attempted attack.
    

## **Introduction to Linux Protocols**

Linux operating systems often use specific protocols to facilitate secure communication. Here are two commonly used protocols:
**1.** **SSH (Secure Shell)**

-   **Port Number:** 22
    
-   **Description:** SSH is a protocol used to securely access and manage remote devices over a network. It encrypts the connection, ensuring that even if someone intercepts the data, they won't be able to read it. This is particularly useful for system administrators who need to manage servers remotely.
    
-   **Use Case:** If you want to log into a remote server to perform updates or manage files, you would use SSH to establish a secure connection.
    

**2.** **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**

-   **Port Number:** 21 (for command) / 20 (for data transfer)
    
-   **Description:** FTP is used for transferring files between computers on a network. While standard FTP does not encrypt data, secure versions like FTPS (FTP Secure) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) use encryption to protect the data during transfer.
    
-   **Use Case:** If you need to upload or download files from a web server, you would use FTP or one of its secure variants, such as FTPS or SFTP.
    

**3.** **NFS (Network File System)**

-   **Port Number:** 2049
    
-   **Description:** NFS allows a user on a client computer to access files over a network in the same way they would access local storage. It enables sharing of files and directories between Linux systems.
    
-   **Use Case:** If you want to share files between multiple Linux servers or allow users on different machines to access the same files seamlessly, you would use NFS.
    

**4.** **Telnet**

-   **Port Number:** 23
    
-   **Description:** Telnet is a protocol used to provide a command-line interface for communication with a remote device. It is not secure because it transmits data, including passwords, in plain text.
    
-   **Use Case:** While it's largely replaced by SSH for secure access, Telnet might still be used for accessing legacy systems or devices that do not support SSH.
    

### Conclusion: 
In this lesson, you learned that network ports play a crucial role in managing communication between devices, acting like doors for different types of data. Additionally, you were introduced to important Linux protocols such as SSH and FTP, which ensure secure data exchange. By understanding ports and protocols, you can better appreciate how networks function and how to secure them effectively.
