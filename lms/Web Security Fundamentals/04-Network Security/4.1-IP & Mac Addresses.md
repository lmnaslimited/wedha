## What is Network Security? 
Every time you connect to Wi-Fi, send an email, or visit a website, your data travels through a network. Therefore, network security is crucial for keeping this data safe and private from threats, attacks, and unauthorized access.

## **How Devices Communicate in a Network**  
In a network, different devices like computers, smartphones, and printers communicate with each other by sending data back and forth. These devices are usually connected either through wired connections (like Ethernet cables) or wirelessly (via Wi-Fi).

## **What are IP Addresses?**  
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is like a mailing address for your computer or device on the internet. It helps identify your device so that it can send and receive data. There are two types of IP addresses:

-  **Public IP Addresses**: These are assigned by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and are unique across the internet. When you connect to the internet, your device is assigned a public IP address that allows it to communicate with other devices and servers worldwide. This address can change if you restart your router or your ISP assigns you a new one.
    
- **Private IP Addresses**: These are used within your home or local network. Each device (like your computer, phone, or smart TV) connected to your router has a private IP address. This address allows devices to communicate with each other over the same network without being visible to the outside world. Private IP addresses are often in the range of 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, or 172.16.x.x.
    

## **What is DNS (Domain Name System)?**  
DNS is like the phonebook of the internet. It translates human-friendly domain names (like [www.lmnas.com](http://www.lmnas.com/) ) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network. When you type a website address in your browser, DNS servers help locate the corresponding IP address, allowing your device to connect to the desired website.

## **What Are MAC Addresses?**  
A MAC address (Media Access Control address) is a unique identifier assigned to the network interface card (NIC) of a device. This address is used to identify devices on a local network and is usually formatted as six pairs of hexadecimal digits (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E).

-   Unlike IP addresses, MAC addresses do not change. They are hardcoded into the hardware of the device, which means that every device has a distinct MAC address.
    

## **The Role of IP and MAC Addresses in Device Identification**

-   **Communication**: When you send data over the internet, your device uses its IP address to identify itself. The data packet includes both the sender's and recipient's IP addresses to ensure it reaches the correct destination.
    
-   **Local Networking**: On a local network, devices use MAC addresses to communicate directly with each other. When your computer wants to send data to your printer, it uses the printer's MAC address to ensure the data is sent correctly.
    

  
  

### **Conclusion:**

To wrap up, this lesson covered the essential elements of network communication, including the functions of IP and MAC addresses. Understanding these concepts is crucial for establishing a secure network and protecting our data from potential threats.
