In this lesson, we will discuss the privacy features that modern browsers provide to help protect your personal information while you browse the internet. These features are designed to give you more control over your online privacy and to keep your activities private.

## Overview of Browser Privacy Features
-   **Private Browsing (Incognito Mode)**: When you use private browsing, your browser doesn’t save your browsing history, cookies, or form data. This means that when you close the private window, there’s no record of the websites you visited, making it useful for browsing without leaving a trace on your device.
    
-   **Cookie Management**: Cookies are small pieces of data stored on your computer by websites. Browsers allow you to manage cookies, which means you can choose to delete them or block certain types. This helps prevent websites from tracking your online activities.
