# **Web Security Overview**

An introduction to the fundamental concepts of web security, exploring common threats, vulnerabilities, and why securing web applications is essential.

## **Lesson Structure**

### Lesson 1: **Understanding Browser Vulnerabilities**

Focus on how browsers can be exploited due to vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and clickjacking. Explore how attackers use these to bypass browser defenses and how browsers have evolved to mitigate and prevent them.

### Lesson 2: **The Role of Browser Sandboxing**

Explore how modern browsers isolate web pages and processes to prevent malicious code from affecting the entire system. This lesson would explain the concept of sandboxing and its importance in ensuring safe web interactions.

### **Lesson 3: The Importance of Security in Web Development and Maintenance**

Learn why security should be an integral part of the web development process. This lesson will cover secure coding practices, regular updates, monitoring, and the use of encryption (e.g., HTTPS) to maintain a secure application.

### **Lesson 4: The Impact of Security Breaches**

Discover the consequences of web security breaches, including data loss, financial damage, and reputational harm. Analyze real-life case studies and understand the steps to take to prevent and respond to breaches.

### **Lesson 4: Knowledge Check**
Test your knowledge with  a quiz to reinforce learning.
