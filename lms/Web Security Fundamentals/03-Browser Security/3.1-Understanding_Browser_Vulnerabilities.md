Browsers are tools we use every day, but they can also be targeted by attackers. In this lesson, we’ll explain common browser vulnerabilities in simple terms and how the information browsers store, known as **artifacts**, can be exploited.

## **Key Browser Artifacts:**

-   **Web History**: A record of websites you’ve visited.
    
-   **Cache**: Temporary storage for web content to make pages load faster.
    
-   **Cookies**: Small pieces of data that help websites remember your login or preferences.
    
-   **Other artifacts include**: Search history, Downloads, Bookmarks, Favicons, Sessions, Form history, Thumbnails, Extensions.
