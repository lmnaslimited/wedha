Browsers are tools we use every day, but they can also be targeted by attackers. In this lesson, we’ll explain common browser vulnerabilities in simple terms and how the information browsers store, known as **artifacts**, can be exploited.

## **Key Browser Artifacts:**

-   **Web History**: A record of websites you’ve visited.
    
-   **Cache**: Temporary storage for web content to make pages load faster.
    
-   **Cookies**: Small pieces of data that help websites remember your login or preferences.
    
-   **Other artifacts include**: Search history, Downloads, Bookmarks, Favicons, Sessions, Form history, Thumbnails, Extensions.

## **Common Browser Vulnerabilities:**
-  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Attackers inject malicious code into trusted websites. They may steal cookies or manipulate cached files, leading to unauthorized access from the end users.
    
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: This tricks your browser into performing actions like sending requests on your behalf. Attackers exploit cookies, which are automatically sent by browsers.
    
- **Clickjacking**: Attackers hide harmful links or buttons behind legitimate ones, tricking users into clicking on something unintended.

## **How Artifacts Play a Role:**

-   **Cookies**: Can be stolen to impersonate users or access sensitive data.
    
-   **Cache**: Harmful scripts can stay in the cache, reactivating even after leaving a website.
    
-   **Web History**: Attackers may learn about your browsing habits to plan more targeted attacks.
    

**Conclusion**: Browser vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, and Clickjacking are dangerous because they exploit the data stored in artifacts. Keeping your browser updated and clearing cookies and cache regularly can help protect against these threats.
