In this lesson, we will focus on common browser vulnerabilities and how attackers exploit them. Understanding these vulnerabilities is crucial for both users and developers to enhance our online safety.

## Key Points:

1.  **Recognizing Common Vulnerabilities**:
    
    -   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Be cautious when clicking on links, especially from unknown sources. If a website looks suspicious, avoid entering personal information as field values.
