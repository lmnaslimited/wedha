# Email Authentication Techniques
Email authentication is a critical aspect of email security that helps verify the identity of the sender and prevent unauthorized users from sending messages on behalf of legitimate domains. This lesson focuses on three key authentication techniques: SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance). Together, these techniques enhance email security and reduce the risk of email spoofing, phishing, and other malicious activities.
#### **Understanding Email Spoofing**

Email spoofing occurs when a malicious actor forges the sender's address to make it appear as though the email is coming from a trusted source. This deceptive practice is often used in phishing attacks, where attackers aim to trick recipients into providing sensitive information or downloading malware. Email authentication techniques are designed to combat this issue by ensuring that only authorized senders can send emails from a particular domain.
