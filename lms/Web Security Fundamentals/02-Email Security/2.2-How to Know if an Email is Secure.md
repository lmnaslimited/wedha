# How to Know if an Email is Secure
Email security plays a critical role in protecting your personal information and sensitive data. This lesson focuses on the key indicators to look for when determining whether an email is secure:

#### **Encryption in Transit**

Encryption ensures that your email is protected as it travels from sender to recipient. When an email is sent over a secure connection, protocols like SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) encrypt the content, making it unreadable to third parties. To check if your email is encrypted during transmission, look for “https://” in the browser’s URL bar and a lock icon, which signifies a secure connection.

#### **Digital Signatures**

Digital signatures verify the authenticity of an email and ensure that the content has not been altered during transit. They are applied using technologies like DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) or S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions). When an email contains a valid digital signature, it proves that the sender is legitimate, and the message has not been tampered with, which enhances trust and security.

#### **Email Authentication**

Email authentication protocols such as SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM, and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) work together to prevent email spoofing and phishing attacks. SPF ensures that emails are sent from authorized servers, DKIM adds a signature to verify the message’s integrity, and DMARC aligns these protocols to validate the sender’s identity. These tools help to verify whether the email genuinely comes from the sender's domain, reducing the risk of impersonation and fraud.

By understanding and checking these security elements, you can significantly reduce the risks associated with insecure emails and safeguard your communications.
