# Email Encryption
### **What is Email Encryption?**

Email encryption involves converting plain text messages into ciphertext, a scrambled format that is unreadable to anyone who does not possess the correct decryption key. This process ensures that even if a malicious actor intercepts an email, they cannot comprehend its content. Encryption can be applied to both the message body and any attachments, providing a comprehensive layer of security.
