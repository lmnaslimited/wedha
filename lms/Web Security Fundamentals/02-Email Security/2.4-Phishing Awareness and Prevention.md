# Phishing Awareness and Prevention

#### **Introduction to Phishing**

Phishing is one of the most prevalent forms of cyberattacks, where attackers disguise themselves as a trustworthy entity to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information. These attacks typically occur through email but can also happen via text messages, social media, or fake websites. Understanding phishing tactics is crucial to protecting yourself and your organization from data breaches, financial loss, and identity theft.

#### **How Phishing Works**

Attackers craft emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate sources, such as banks, popular online services, or even colleagues. They often include alarming or urgent language, such as "Your account has been compromised" or "Immediate action required," to create a sense of urgency and pressure the victim into responding without careful consideration. These messages typically contain links to fake websites that look genuine or attachments that, when opened, install malware on the victim’s device.
#### **Recognizing Phishing Emails**

To protect yourself from phishing attacks, it’s essential to recognize the warning signs of a phishing email:

-   **Suspicious Links:** Hover over any links in the email to check the URL. If it looks strange or doesn’t match the legitimate website, it’s likely a phishing attempt.
-   **Poor Grammar and Spelling:** Phishing emails often contain grammatical errors or awkward phrasing, which is a red flag.
-   **Unexpected Attachments:** Be cautious of unsolicited attachments, especially if you weren’t expecting a file from the sender.
-   **Mismatched Email Addresses:** Phishers often use email addresses that look similar to legitimate ones but with slight alterations, like extra characters or misspellings.
#### **Common Phishing Techniques**

Phishing attacks come in various forms, including:

-   **Spear Phishing:** Targeted attacks aimed at a specific individual or organization, often using personalized information to appear more convincing.
-   **Whaling:** A form of phishing that targets high-level executives or "big fish" within a company.
-   **Smishing and Vishing:** Phishing through SMS text messages ("smishing") or voice calls ("vishing") to trick victims into sharing sensitive information.
