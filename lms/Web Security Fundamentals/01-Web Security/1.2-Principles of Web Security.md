# Principles of Web Security

The key aspects of Web security is **Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability.**

### Confidentiality
Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized users. This principle involves protecting data from unauthorized access or disclosure. Techniques like encryption, strong password policies, and access controls help maintain confidentiality.

### Integrity
Integrity means ensuring that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered during storage or transmission. It prevents unauthorized users from tampering with information. Techniques such as hashing, digital signatures, and data validation are used to maintain data integrity.

### Availability

Availability ensures that web applications and data are accessible to authorized users whenever needed. This principle involves protecting against disruptions, such as server failures or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Regular maintenance, backups, and implementing redundancy help maintain availability.

## How These Principles Work Together
Confidentiality, integrity, and availability—known as the CIA triad—are the foundation of web security. These principles guide security best practices, helping to create secure web applications that protect data and maintain user trust. For example, a banking website must ensure that transactions are confidential, accurate, and accessible whenever needed.
