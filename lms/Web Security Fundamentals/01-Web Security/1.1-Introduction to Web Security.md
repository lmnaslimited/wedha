# Introduction To Web Security
Web security refers to the protective measures and protocols put in place to safeguard websites, web applications, and users from cyber threats. It's essential to ensure that data transmitted between a user's browser and a website remains confidential and is not tampered with or intercepted by malicious actors.

## **Why is Web Security Important?**  
Web security is crucial because it helps:

-   **Protect Sensitive Information:** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data such as personal information, payment details, and login credentials.
-   **Maintain Trust:** Users need to trust that their data is safe when interacting with your website or application.
-   **Prevent Financial and Reputational Damage:** Security breaches can lead to significant financial losses and damage a companyâ€™s reputation.

## **Common Challenges in Web Security**

Web applications face numerous challenges, such as:

-   **Evolving Threats:** Cyber attackers constantly develop new methods to exploit vulnerabilities.
-   **Complexity of Web Applications:** Modern web applications are complex, making it harder to identify and fix potential security flaws.
-   **Human Error:** Misconfigurations, weak passwords, or coding mistakes can introduce vulnerabilities.
