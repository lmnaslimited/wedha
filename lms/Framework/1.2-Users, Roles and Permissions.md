# Users, Roles and Permissions


LENS comes with User and Role management out of the box. A **User** is someone who can login to the system and perform authorized actions like creating, updating or deleting records. A **Role** is a mapping of DocTypes and actions allowed to perform on it.

### Permission Levels

1.  Permissions at level 0 are Document Level permissions, i.e. they are primary for access to the document.
2.  If a Role does not have access at Level 0, then higher levels are meaningless.
3. 1.  You can use Customize Form to set levels on fields.  Setup > Customize Form
