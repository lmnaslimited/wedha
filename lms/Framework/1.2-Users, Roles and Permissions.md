# **Users, Roles and Permissions**


LENS comes with User and Role management out of the box. A **User** is someone who can login to the system and perform authorized actions like creating, updating or deleting records. A **Role** is a mapping of DocTypes and actions allowed to perform on it.

### Permission Levels:

1. Permissions at level 0 are Document Level permissions, i.e. they are primary for access to the document.
2. If a Role does not have access at Level 0, then higher levels are meaningless.
3. You can use Customize Form to set levels on fields.  Setup > Customize Form.

### User Permissions:

1.  User Permissions are used to limit users to specific records.  Setup > User Permissions.
2.  Select Document Types to set which User Permissions are used to limit access.
3.  Once you have set this, the users will only be able access documents (eg. Blog Post) where the link exists (eg. Blogger).
4.  Apart from System Manager, roles with Set User Permissions right can set permissions for other users for that Document Type.
