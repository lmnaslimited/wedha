# What is DocType

A DocType is the core building block of any application based on the **LENS** Framework. It describes the **Model** and the **View** of your data. It contains what fields are stored for your data, and how they behave with respect to each other.

The standard way to create a DocType is by typing _new doctype_ in the search bar in the **Desk**.

### Creating DocType:

1. Go to the Desk and type the new DocType in the search bar.
2. Enter the name of the new DocType.
3. Select the module that the DocType will belong to.
4. Add fields for that corresponding DocType and also its field type, options, etc.
5. Click the 'Save' button to create the new DocType.
