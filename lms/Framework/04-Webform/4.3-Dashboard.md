## Different Ways to Customize a Dashboard

LENS allows for flexible customization of dashboards to fit different use cases. Here are some methods:

### A. Using Different Chart Types

Each dashboard can include different types of charts:

-   **Bar Charts**: Best for comparing categories like "Monthly Sales by Product" or "Expense by Department."
-   **Line Charts**: Useful for tracking trends over time, such as "Revenue Growth Over the Year" or "Inventory Usage Trends."
-   **Pie Charts**: Ideal for displaying proportions, such as "Sales Contribution by Region" or "Profit Distribution by Product Line."

### B. Filtering Data Based on Time Frames

You can set filters for charts to display data over specific time frames. For example:

-   "Sales in the Last 30 Days" to track recent performance.
-   "Expenses This Quarter" to monitor costs within a specific period.

### C. Adding Multiple Data Sources

You can create dashboards that pull data from different modules. For example:

-   **Sales Dashboard**: Combine sales invoice data, customer leads, and revenue to get an overview of sales performance.
-   **Inventory Dashboard**: Display stock levels, reorder points, and inventory turnover.
-   **Finance Dashboard**: Use accounting data to display income, expenses, and profitability.

### D. Dynamic Data Views with Links

Dashboards can include links to detailed reports or forms. For example, a chart showing "Top 5 Customers by Sales" can be linked to the customer records for quick access.
