# Web Form in LENS

A **Web Form** is a custom form that captures data from external users and stores it within LENS. It is linked to a particular DocType, which defines where the data is saved. Web Forms can be used to collect information like leads, customer feedback, job applications, event registrations, and more.

## Key Features

-   Public-facing (can be accessed by users who are not logged into LENS).
-   Linked to a DocType, allowing direct insertion of form submissions into the LENS database.
-   Customizable fields, layout, and validations.
-   Form responses can trigger workflows or notifications within LENS.
