# Web Form in LENS

A **Web Form** is a custom form that captures data from external users and stores it within LENS. It is linked to a particular DocType, which defines where the data is saved. Web Forms can be used to collect information like leads, customer feedback, job applications, event registrations, and more.

## Key Features

-   Public-facing (can be accessed by users who are not logged into LENS).
-   Linked to a DocType, allowing direct insertion of form submissions into the LENS database.
-   Customizable fields, layout, and validations.
-   Form responses can trigger workflows or notifications within LENS.

## Create a Web Form

#### Step 1: Navigate to the Web Form List

1.  Go to the **Website** module.
2.  Under **Forms**, click on **Web Form**.

#### Step 2: Create a New Web Form

1.  Click on **New** to create a new Web Form.
2.  Fill in the following fields:
    -   **Title**: The name of the Web Form.
    -   **DocType**: Select the DocType where the data will be saved (e.g., Lead, Customer, Job Application).
    -   **Is Standard**: If unchecked, the form is customizable. Leave it unchecked for creating custom forms.
    -   **Allow Edit**: Check this box if users are allowed to edit the data they have submitted.
    -   **Login Required**: Check this box if you want the form to be accessed by logged-in users only.

#### Step 3: Add Fields

1.  Under the **Fields** section, click **Add Row** to insert fields into the form.
2.  Select the fields from the linked DocType that you want to appear on the form.
    -   For example, if you are creating a Lead form, you can include fields like **Lead Name**, **Email**, **Phone Number**, etc.
3.  You can also configure field properties, such as **mandatory fields**, **read-only fields**, and **default values**.

#### Step 4: Configure Form Behavior

1.  **Success Message**: Add a message that will be shown after a successful form submission (e.g., "Thank you for submitting!").
2.  **Allow Attachments**: Check this box if users are required to upload files (e.g., resumes for job applications).
3.  **Redirect to**: Set the URL where the user will be redirected after submitting the form, if needed.
4.  **Submit Button Label**: Customize the text of the submit button (e.g., "Register Now").

#### Step 5: Publish the Web Form

1.  Click **Save**.
2.  After saving, you will see a URL generated for your Web Form. You can share this URL with users or embed it on your website.
