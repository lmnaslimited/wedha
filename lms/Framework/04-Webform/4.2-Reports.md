# Reports

Reports in ERPNext are dynamic representations of data stored in the system's DocTypes. Reports allow users to:

-   View, filter, and group data for analysis.
-   Export data into formats such as Excel or PDF.
-   Schedule and send reports via email.
-   Set up permissions to control who can view specific reports.

Reports can be accessed from any module, and ERPNext provides both predefined reports and the ability to create custom ones.
