# Reports

Reports in LENS are dynamic representations of data stored in the system's DocTypes. Reports allow users to:

-   View, filter, and group data for analysis.
-   Export data into formats such as Excel or PDF.
-   Schedule and send reports via email.
-   Set up permissions to control who can view specific reports.

Reports can be accessed from any module, and LENS provides both predefined reports and the ability to create custom ones.

### Types of Reports in LENS

LENS offers different types of reports, each designed for a specific purpose. These reports include:

1.  **List View Reports**
2.  **Query Reports**
3.  **Script Reports**
4.  **Print Format Reports**
5.  **Dashboard Reports**

#### 1. List View Reports

A **List View Report** is the most basic type of report, displaying a table of records for a specific DocType in the form of a list. Each entry in the list represents one document, and columns represent fields from that document.

#### Features:

-   Filter records by different criteria.
-   Customize columns to show relevant fields.
-   Export the report data in CSV or Excel format.

#### Example:

-   **Sales Invoice List**: A list of all Sales Invoices, where you can filter by status, date, customer, or amount.

#### How to Access:

Navigate to a DocType (e.g., Sales Invoice), and you will see the **List View** as the default report. You can filter records and customize columns from this view.

#### 2. Query Reports

**Query Reports** are custom reports based on SQL queries. These reports allow advanced users to write complex SQL queries to retrieve data from multiple tables (DocTypes) and join them to create a comprehensive report.

#### Features:

-   Support complex queries and calculations.
-   Provide high flexibility and customization.
-   Data can be filtered dynamically after running the report.

#### Example:

-   **General Ledger Report**: A report showing ledger transactions across multiple accounts, pulled from various tables such as Journal Entries, Sales Invoices, and Payments.

#### How to Create:

1.  Go to **Reports** > **Query Report** > **New Query Report**.
2.  Write an SQL query that retrieves the data you want.
3.  You can add filters for dynamic data extraction.

#### 3. Script Reports

**Script Reports** are similar to Query Reports, but instead of using SQL queries, they use Python scripts to fetch and process data. This method is powerful when the required report logic cannot be achieved through SQL queries alone.

#### Features:

-   Perform complex business logic in Python.
-   Fetch data from multiple sources or external APIs.
-   Full control over data processing.

#### Example:

-   **Item-wise Sales Report**: A custom report that shows sales by item category, sales amount, and quantity sold, based on specific custom calculations.

#### How to Create:

1.  Navigate to **Reports** > **Script Report** > **New Script Report**.
2.  Write a Python script to fetch and process the data.

#### 4. Print Format Reports

**Print Format Reports** are tailored for documents that need to be printed or shared in specific formats (e.g., invoices, quotations, or purchase orders). These reports are highly customizable and allow you to design templates for easy printing or PDF generation.

#### Features:

-   Customize the layout using HTML and CSS.
-   Include company logos, headers, and footers.
-   Exportable as PDFs for sharing with customers or vendors.

#### Example:

-   **Sales Invoice Print Format**: A customized invoice format that includes your company logo, customer details, item descriptions, and totals.

#### How to Create:

1.  Go to **Print Format** in the **Customization** module.
2.  Create a new print format by defining the layout and design using HTML/CSS.

#### 5. Dashboard Reports

**Dashboard Reports** are visual reports that display data in the form of charts and graphs. They are ideal for tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and other metrics at a glance. You can embed these reports in dashboards for real-time data visualization.

#### Features:

-   Create charts like bar graphs, line charts, pie charts, and more.
-   Dynamic and interactive visualizations.
-   Can be embedded in dashboards for quick access.

#### Example:

-   **Sales Funnel**: A dashboard report showing the sales pipeline, where you can visualize the number of leads, opportunities, and converted customers over time.

#### How to Create:

1.  Navigate to **Dashboard** > **New Dashboard**.
2.  Create a new dashboard chart and choose the chart type (bar, line, pie, etc.).
3.  Configure the data source and display fields.
