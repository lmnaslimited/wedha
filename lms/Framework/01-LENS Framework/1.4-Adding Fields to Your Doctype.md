# **Adding Fields to Your Doctype:**
Adding fields to your Doctype in LENS allows you to add various fields to capture the specific data you need. Hereâ€™s a simplified guide to doing this:

#### **Steps:**
1.  **Access the DocType List:**
    -   Start by navigating to your custom Doctype in LENS.
    -   Open the DocType you created previously.

2.  **Add Fields:**
     -   **Item Name (Data):** A simple text field where you can enter the name of an item, such as "Laptop" or "Office Chair."
     -   **Description (Text):** A larger text field for a detailed description of the item, including features or specifications.
     -   **Quantity (Int):** An integer field to store the quantity of items available or needed.
     -   **Price (Float):** A field to store the price of the item, allowing for decimal values like "19.99."
     -   **Manufacture Date (Date):** A date field to record when the item was manufactured.
     -   **In Stock (Check):** A checkbox to indicate if the item is currently in stock.
     -   **Category (Select):** A dropdown menu with predefined options like "Electronics," "Furniture," and "Apparel" for easy categorization.
     -   **Supplier (Link):** A link to another Doctype, such as "Supplier," to identify who provides the item.
 
3.  **Save and Test:**
    
    -   After adding the fields, save your changes to the Doctype.
    -   To test, create a few records by entering data into each field. This helps you verify that the fields are working as expected and that the data is stored correctly in the database.
