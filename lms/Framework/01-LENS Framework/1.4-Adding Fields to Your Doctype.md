# Adding Fields to Your Doctype:
Adding fields to your Doctype in LENS allows you to add various fields to capture the specific data you need. Here’s a simplified guide to doing this:

#### **Steps:**
1.  **Access the DocType List:**
    -   Start by navigating to your custom Doctype in LENS.
    -   Open the DocType you created previously.

2.  **Add Fields:**
     -   **Item Name (Data):** A simple text field where you can enter the name of an item, such as "Laptop" or "Office Chair."
     -   **Description (Text):** A larger text field for a detailed description of the item, including features or specifications.
     -   **Quantity (Int):** An integer field to store the quantity of items available or needed.
     -   **Price (Float):** A field to store the price of the item, allowing for decimal values like "19.99."
     -   **Manufacture Date (Date):** A date field to record when the item was manufactured.
     -   **In Stock (Check):** A checkbox to indicate if the item is currently in stock.
     -   **Category (Select):** A dropdown menu with predefined options like "Electronics," "Furniture," and "Apparel" for easy categorization.
     -   **Supplier (Link):** A link to another Doctype, such as "Supplier," to identify who provides the item.
 
3.  **Save and Test:**
    
    -   After adding the fields, save your changes to the Doctype.
    -   To test, create a few records by entering data into each field. This helps you verify that the fields are working as expected and that the data is stored correctly in the database.

## Docstatus

**Docstatus** is a field in LENS that indicates the status of a document (record) within a DocType. It helps in managing the workflow of documents by categorizing them based on their state. The common values for `docstatus` are:

-   **0**: Draft – The document is still being created and not finalized.
-   **1**: Submitted – The document has been submitted and is now part of the workflow.
-   **2**: Cancelled – The document has been cancelled and is no longer active.

## Example of Docstatus

**Draft** (`docstatus = 0`):

-   The sales order is being created but not yet finalized.
```python
sales_order = frappe.get_doc({
    "doctype": "Sales Order",
    "customer": "Customer A",
    "items": [{"item_code": "Item 1", "qty": 2}]
})
sales_order.insert()  # docstatus is 0
```

**Submitted** (`docstatus = 1`):

-   Once you review and finalize the order, you submit it.
```python
sales_order.submit()  # docstatus changes to 1
```

**Cancelled** (`docstatus = 2`):

-   If you need to cancel the order after submission, you can do so.
```python
sales_order.cancel()  # docstatus changes to 2
```

## Naming in DocType

In LENS, **naming** refers to how a document (or record) is identified within a DocType.

#### 1. Naming Series

-   **Definition**: A naming series allows users to define a custom sequence or pattern for naming documents. It can include prefixes, suffixes, and numeric sequences.
-   **Usage**: Useful for maintaining order and consistency in naming documents.

#### 2. Naming Rule

-   **Definition**: Naming rules dictate how names are generated for new documents. This includes specifying which fields to use and the format for constructing the name.
-   **Implementation**: Rules can include static text, dynamic fields, and date or counter values.

#### 3. Auto Name

-   **Definition**: Auto naming automatically generates a unique name for a document based on a predefined format when the document is created.
    
-   **Formats**:
    
    -   **Field-based**: Using specific fields to create the name (e.g., `Customer-{customer_id}`).
    -   **Counter**: Incremental numbering (e.g., `Sales Invoice-0001`).

#### 4. Name Case

-   **Definition**: Name case refers to the formatting of the document name, which can be specified as upper case, lower case, or title case. This ensures uniformity and readability.
-   **Example**:
    -   Title Case: "Sales Order"
    -   Upper Case: "SALES ORDER"
