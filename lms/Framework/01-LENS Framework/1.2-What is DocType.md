# What is DocType

A **Doctype** is a core component in the LENS Framework, representing the schema for data storage. It defines the structure of the data, including fields, field types, permissions, and more.

The standard way to create a DocType is by typing _new doctype_ in the search bar in the **Desk**.

### Single DocType:

A Single DocType is a DocType that has only one instance in the database. It is useful for persisting things like _System Settings_, which don't make sense to have multiple records.

### Child / Table DocType:

A Child DocType is doctype which can only be linked to a parent DocType. To make a Child DocType make sure to check **Is Child Table** while creating the doctype.

To link a Child Doctype to its parent, add another row in Parent Doctype with field type **Table** and options as **Child Table**.

Child DocType records are directly attached to the parent doc.

### Create a Custom DocType:

1. Go to DocType List in the search bar.
2. Click on **"+ Add Doctype"**.
3. Enter Doctype **Name** and the respective **Module**.
4. Add fields by clicking on **"Add Row"** in the **Fields** section.
5. Specify the **Label**, **Field Type** (e.g., Data, Date, Select), and other properties like Mandatory, Read Only, etc.
6. Once youâ€™ve added all the fields and settings, click **"Save"**.
