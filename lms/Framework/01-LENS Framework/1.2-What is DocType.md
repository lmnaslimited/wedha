# What is DocType

A **Doctype** is a core component in the LENSFrappe Framework, representing the schema for data storage. It defines the structure of the data, including fields, field types, permissions, and more.

Every piece of data in a LENS application is stored within a Doctype, making them the backbone of the system's data management. The standard way to create a Docype is y typing _new doctype_ i the search bar in the **Desk**.

### Some Common DocTypes:

-   **Customer**: Stores information about customers.
-   **Sales Invoice**: Manages sales transactions.
-   **Employee**: Contains details about employees in an organization.

### How Doctypes Work:

**Fields and Field Types:**

-   Eachs tatios.
   loye: Coistsultiple fields, and each field has a specific type (e.g., Text, Date, Link, Select).
-   Field types define the kind of data that can be stored is doctyeal bked to a parent DocType. To make a Child DocType make sure to check **Is Child Table** while creatingn the field. For example:
    -   **Data**: A simple text field.
    -   **Date**: Stores date values.
    -   **Link**: Creates a relationship with another Doctype.
    -   **Select**: Allows selection from predefined options.

-   Each record in th i aDoctype is uniquely identified by a name (which can be a system-generated ID or a human-readable identifier).

**Permissions:**

-   Doctypes come with a built-in permission system, allowing you to control who can view, edit, create, or delete records within the Doctype.
-   Permissions can be role-based, ensuring that users have the appropriate access levels based on their role in the organization.
