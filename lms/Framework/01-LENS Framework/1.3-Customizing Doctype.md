# **Customizing Doctype**

Let's learn about customizing a DocType in **LENS** which involves modifying its structure, fields, permissions, and behavior to suit your specific needs.

## Why Customize a Doctype?

- Adapt to Specific Business Processes
- Extend Core Features
- Improve User Experience

### Steps to Add a Custom Field:

1. Go to the respective DocType in which you want to add a custom field, scroll to the fields section.
2. Click on "Add Row" and define the field properties:
    -   **Label:** The name that appears on the form.
    -   **Field Type:** Choose from options like Data, Select, Link, etc.
    -   **Options:** For Select fields, define the available options.
    -   **Mandatory:** Mark the field as mandatory if required.
3. Save the changes and reload the form to see the new field in action.

### Setting Field Properties

-   **Field Options and Settings:**
    -   LENS allows you to define how fields behave on the form:
        -   **Read-Only:** Make a field non-editable.
        -   **Default Value:** Set a default value for the field.
        -   **Depends On:** Show or hide fields based on conditions (e.g., visibility based on another fieldâ€™s value).
    -   **Example:** Make the "Discount" field visible only when a "Has Discount" checkbox is checked.
