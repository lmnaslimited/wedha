# **Customizing Doctype**

Let's learn about customizing a DocType in **LENS** which involves modifying its structure, fields, permissions, and behavior to suit your specific needs.

## Why Customize a Doctype?

- Adapt to Specific Business Processes
- Extend Core Features
- Improve User Experience

### Steps to Add a Custom Field:

1. Permissions at level 0 are Document Level permissions, i.e. they are primary for access to the document.
2. If a Role does not have access at Level 0, then higher levels are meaningless.
3. You can use Customize Form to set levels on fields.  Setup > Customize Form.

### User Permissions:

1.  User Permissions are used to limit users to specific records.  Setup > User Permissions.
2.  Select Document Types to set which User Permissions are used to limit access.
3.  Once you have set this, the users will only be able access documents (eg. Blog Post) where the link exists (eg. Blogger).
4.  Apart from System Manager, roles with Set User Permissions right can set permissions for other users for that Document Type.
