### **Adding Fields to Your Custom Doctype:**
Customizing a Doctype in LENS allows you to add various fields to capture the specific data you need. Here’s a simplified guide to doing this:

#### **Steps:**

1.  **Access the Customize Form Tool:**
    
    -   Start by navigating to your custom Doctype in LENS.
    -   Use the Customize Form tool to open the Doctype. This tool allows you to modify the structure of your Doctype by adding and configuring fields.
1.  **Add Fields:**
    
    -   Use the Customize Form tool to add the following fields to your Doctype:
        -   **Item Name (Data):** A simple text field where you can enter the name of an item, such as "Laptop" or "Office Chair."
        -   **Description (Text):** A larger text field for a detailed description of the item, including features or specifications.
        -   **Quantity (Int):** An integer field to store the quantity of items available or needed.
        -   **Price (Float):** A field to store the price of the item, allowing for decimal values like "19.99."
        -   **Manufacture Date (Date):** A date field to record when the item was manufactured.
        -   **In Stock (Check):** A checkbox to indicate if the item is currently in stock.
        -   **Category (Select):** A dropdown menu with predefined options like "Electronics," "Furniture," and "Apparel" for easy categorization.
        -   **Supplier (Link):** A link to another Doctype, such as "Supplier," to identify who provides the item.
2.  **Save and Test:**
    
    -   After adding the fields, save your changes to the Doctype.
    -   To test, create a few records by entering data into each field. This helps you verify that the fields are working as expected and that the data is stored correctly in the database.

By following these steps, you’ll have a customized Doctype with fields tailored to your needs, and you’ll understand how these fields map to and store data in the system.
