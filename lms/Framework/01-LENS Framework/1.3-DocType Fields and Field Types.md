# DocType Fields and Field Types

### **Field Types Overview:**

In LENS, a wide variety of field types are available to accommodate different kinds of data and their respective use cases. Each field type is designed with specific data handling capabilities, making it easier to manage and organize information within your application.

### Field Types Explained:
**Data:**

-   **Description:** A basic text field designed to store short strings of text, such as names, titles, or brief descriptions.
-   **Use Cases:** Names, titles, or any short text input that doesnâ€™t require extensive formatting or length.
-   **Text:**
    
    -   **Description:** A larger text field intended for more substantial text content, allowing for longer descriptions or detailed notes.
    -   **Use Cases:** Product descriptions, detailed notes, comments, or any information requiring more space than a simple Data field.
-   **Small Text:**
    
    -   **Description:** A smaller variant of the Text field, meant for shorter passages that are still more extensive than a Data field.
    -   **Use Cases:** Brief descriptions, short paragraphs, or additional notes.
-   **Int (Integer):**
    
    -   **Description:** Stores whole numbers without any decimal points, ideal for numeric data where precision to fractions is unnecessary.
    -   **Use Cases:** Quantities, counts, identification numbers (IDs), or any situation where only whole numbers are required.
