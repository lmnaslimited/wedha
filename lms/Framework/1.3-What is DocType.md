# What is DocType

A DocType is the core building block of any application based on the **LENS** Framework. It describes the **Model** and the **View** of your data. It contains what fields are stored for your data, and how they behave with respect to each other.

The standard way to create a DocType is by typing _new doctype_ in the search bar in the **Desk**.

### Single DocType:

A Single DocType is a DocType that has only one instance in the database. It is useful for persisting things like _System Settings_, which don't make sense to have multiple records.

### Child / Table DocType:

A Child DocType is doctype which can only be linked to a parent DocType. To make a Child DocType make sure to check **Is Child Table** while creating the doctype.

To link a Child Doctype to its parent, add another row in Parent Doctype with field type **Table** and options as **Child Table**.

Child DocType records are directly attached to the parent doc.

2. Select the DocType that you want to add the custom field to.
**Label:**  The label that will be displayed for the custom field.
**Field Type:**  The type of data that the custom field will store.
**Name:**  The field name for the custom field.
