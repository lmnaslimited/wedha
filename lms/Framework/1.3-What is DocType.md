# What is DocType

A DocType is the core building block of any application based on the **LENS** Framework. It describes the **Model** and the **View** of your data. It contains what fields are stored for your data, and how they behave with respect to each other.

The standard way to create a DocType is by typing _new doctype_ in the search bar in the **Desk**.

### Single DocType:

A Single DocType is a DocType that has only one instance in the database. It is useful for persisting things like _System Settings_, which don't make sense to have multiple records.
