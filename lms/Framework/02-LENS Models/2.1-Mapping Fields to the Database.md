#  Mapping Fields to the Database 
  
Client Scripts in LENS Framework allow you to control the front-end behavior of forms using JavaScript. This is particularly useful for adding dynamic interactions, validations, and custom logic directly in the user interface without modifying the core code.
  

## Key Concepts  
  

### Triggers and Events:  

 - Client Scripts can be triggered by various events such as `onload`, `validate`, `refresh`, `change`, etc.
 - These events correspond to different stages in the lifecycle of a form (e.g., when the form is loaded, when a field value is changed, before saving, etc.).
  
### Field Manipulation:  
  
 - You can manipulate form fields—such as setting values, hiding/showing fields, or making fields mandatory—based on certain conditions.

### Custom Validation:
  
 - Add custom validation logic to ensure that the data entered by users meets specific criteria before submission.

  
### Create a Client Script:
**Steps:**

 1. Click on the **"+"** near to the Client Script to create a new Client Script.
 2. Fill in the following details:
	  - **DocType**: The DocType on which this script should run (e.g., `Sales Order`).
	  - **Enabled**: Ensure this is checked to enable the script.
3. In the **Script** field, write your JavaScript code.
