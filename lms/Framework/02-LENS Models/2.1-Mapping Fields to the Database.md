#  Mapping Fields to the Database 
  
Each field in a Doctype corresponds to a column in the database table. When you create or modify a Doctype, LENS automatically generates the necessary SQL schema changes.  

### Observing Field Mapping:  

**Task:** Examine how the fields you added are represented in the database.
**Steps:**
1.  **Access the Database:**
**Endpoint:** `https://your-site-name/api/resource/YourDoctypeName`
**Response:** The server will return the data in JSON format, which you can parse and use in your application.

For Example:
```

  
### Create a Client Script:
**Steps:**

 1. Click on the **"+"** near to the Client Script to create a new Client Script.
 2. Fill in the following details:
	  - **DocType**: The DocType on which this script should run (e.g., `Sales Order`).
	  - **Enabled**: Ensure this is checked to enable the script.
3. In the **Script** field, write your JavaScript code.
