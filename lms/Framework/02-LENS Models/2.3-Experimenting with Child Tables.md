# Experimenting with Child Tables

### What are Child Tables?

 - Child tables in LENS allow you to create a one-to-many relationship between Doctypes. They are used to store related data as sub-items within a parent record.
- **Example:** A Purchase Order might have multiple items listed in a child table, each representing a line item in the order.

### Creating a Child Table:

-   **Task:** Add a child table to your custom Doctype to manage related records.

**Steps:**
   1. **Create a Child Doctype:**
        -   First, create a new Doctype that will serve as the child table. For example, "Item Specification" with fields like "Specification Name" (Data) and "Value" (Data).
    2. **Link the Child Doctype:**
        -   In the parent Doctype (e.g., "Product"), add a new field with the type "Table" and select the child Doctype ("Item Specification") as the table.
    3. **Test the Child Table:**
        -   Save the parent Doctype and try adding multiple specifications to a product record.
        -   Observe how each child record is stored and linked to the parent.

### **Linking Doctypes:**

-   **Understanding Links:**
    -   The Link field type in Frappe is used to establish a relationship between two Doctypes. This is similar to a foreign key in relational databases.
-   **Creating a Link Between Doctypes:**
    -   **Task:** Add a link field to your Doctype to reference another Doctype.
    -   **Steps:**
        1.  **Add a Link Field:**
            -   In your custom Doctype (e.g., "Product"), add a new field with the type "Link."
            -   Set the options to the target Doctype, such as "Supplier."
        2.  **Create and Test Records:**
            -   Create a new product and link it to an existing supplier.
            -   Observe how this link allows you to easily access related records from the linked Doctype.
