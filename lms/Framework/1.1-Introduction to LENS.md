#  **Introduction to LENS**  
  
LMNAs Experience Suite also knows as LENS is a full-stack web framework written in Python and JavaScript with MariaDB as the database. The core philosophy at LENS is write as less code as possible. LENS prefer configuration over code. If a feature is generic and we need it, we put it right into the framework.

#  **Features**  
  

### Rapid Application Development:
  

Cypress supports multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, allowing you to test across different environments.  
  

### Batteries Included:  
  

Cypress supports modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries out of the box, including React, Angular, Vue, and others.  
  

### Real-Time Browser Preview:  
  

Cypress provides a real-time preview of your application and the tests running against it. This helps you see exactly whatâ€™s happening during test execution.  
  

### Automatic Waiting:  
  

Cypress automatically waits for elements to appear, animations to   
complete, and XHR requests to finish, reducing the need for manual wait commands.  
  
### Cypress supports various types of testing:  

-   End-to-End (E2E) Testing.  
-   Integration Testing.  
-   Unit Testing.  
-   API Testing.
