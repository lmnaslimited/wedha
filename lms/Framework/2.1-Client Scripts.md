#  Client Scripts  
  
Client Scripts in LENS Framework allow you to control the front-end behavior of forms using JavaScript. This is particularly useful for adding dynamic interactions, validations, and custom logic directly in the user interface without modifying the core code.
  

# **Key Concepts**  
  

### Triggers and Events:  

 - Client Scripts can be triggered by various events such as `onload`, `validate`, `refresh`, `change`, etc.
 - These events correspond to different stages in the lifecycle of a form (e.g., when the form is loaded, when a field value is changed, before saving, etc.).
  
### Field Manipulation:  
  
 - You can manipulate form fields—such as setting values, hiding/showing fields, or making fields mandatory—based on certain conditions.

### Custom Validation:
  
 - Add custom validation logic to ensure that the data entered by users meets specific criteria before submission.

LENS does not only manage the backend, it also comes with a feature rich admin interface called the Desk. When you create a DocType in LENS, a number of views are generated for it. Some of them are:

- List View supports filtering, sorting and editing of bulk records.
- Form View supports file attachments, PDF format, comments, email, etc.
- The Report Builder supports adding columns, grouping, filtering, sorting and saving it as a configuration.
