#  Client Scripts  
  
Client Scripts in LENS Framework allow you to control the front-end behavior of forms using JavaScript. This is particularly useful for adding dynamic interactions, validations, and custom logic directly in the user interface without modifying the core code.
  

# **Key Concepts**  
  

### Triggers and Events:  

 - Client Scripts can be triggered by various events such as `onload`, `validate`, `refresh`, `change`, etc.
 - These events correspond to different stages in the lifecycle of a form (e.g., when the form is loaded, when a field value is changed, before saving, etc.).
  
### Batteries Included:  
  
Anything that might be needed by a modern web application is probably built into the framework already. PDF generation, Emails, SMS, Web Pages you name it.

### Easy Deployment:  
  
Bench is the all-in-one tool to manage all things LENS. It handles app updates, database migrations, generating configs for nginx and supervisor, scaffolding new apps and much more. 

  
### Rich Admin Interface:  

LENS does not only manage the backend, it also comes with a feature rich admin interface called the Desk. When you create a DocType in LENS, a number of views are generated for it. Some of them are:

- List View supports filtering, sorting and editing of bulk records.
- Form View supports file attachments, PDF format, comments, email, etc.
- The Report Builder supports adding columns, grouping, filtering, sorting and saving it as a configuration.
