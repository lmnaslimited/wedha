LMNAs Experience Suite also knows as LENS is a full-stack web framework written in Python and JavaScript with MariaDB as the database. The core philosophy at LENS is write as less code as possible. LENS prefer configuration over code. If a feature is generic and we need it, we put it right into the framework.  
  

# **Features**  
  

### Rapid Application Development:
  
Creating models, wiring controller code and updating views are all handled by the framework.
  
### Batteries Included:  
  
Anything that might be needed by a modern web application is probably built into the framework already. PDF generation, Emails, SMS, Web Pages you name it.

### Easy Deployment:  
  
Bench is the all-in-one tool to manage all things LENS. It handles app updates, database migrations, generating configs for nginx and supervisor, scaffolding new apps and much more. 

  
### Rich Admin Interface:  

LENS does not only manage the backend, it also comes with a feature rich admin interface called the Desk. When you create a DocType in LENS, a number of views are generated for it. Some of them are:

- List View supports filtering, sorting and editing of bulk records.
- Form View supports file attachments, PDF format, comments, email, etc.
- The Report Builder supports adding columns, grouping, filtering, sorting and saving it as a configuration.
