#  Server Scripts
  
Server Scripts in LENS allow you to execute Python code on the server side, enabling you to add custom business logic, validations, and automate processes directly in the Frappe framework. This is particularly useful when you need to perform operations that are beyond the scope of client-side scripts.
  

## Key Concepts
  

### Script Types:
  
-   **API**: These scripts are executed when a custom API endpoint is called.
-   **Scheduler Event**: These scripts are triggered by scheduled events, such as daily or hourly tasks.
-   **Document Event**: These scripts are triggered by specific events on DocTypes (e.g., `before_save`, `after_insert`).
-   **Permission Query**: These scripts modify the query used to fetch records based on user permissions.
  
### Events:  
  
-   Server Scripts can be hooked into various document events such as `before_insert`, `after_insert`, `before_save`, `after_save`, `before_submit`, `after_submit`, `before_cancel`, and `after_cancel`.
-   These events allow you to inject custom logic at different stages of a document's lifecycle.

  
### Create a Server Script:
**Steps:**

 1. Click on the **"+"** near to the Server Script to create a new Server Script.
 2. Fill in the following details:
	  - **Name**: A unique name for your script.
	  - **Script Type**: Select the type (e.g., `Document Event`, `API`, etc.).
	  - **Enabled**: Ensure this is checked to enable the script.
3. In the **Script** field, write your JavaScript code.
