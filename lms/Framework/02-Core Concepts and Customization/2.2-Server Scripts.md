#  Server Scripts
  
Server Scripts in LENS allow you to execute Python code on the server side, enabling you to add custom business logic, validations, and automate processes directly in the Frappe framework. This is particularly useful when you need to perform operations that are beyond the scope of client-side scripts.
  

## Key Concepts
  

### Script Types:
  
-   **API**: These scripts are executed when a custom API endpoint is called.
-   **Scheduler Event**: These scripts are triggered by scheduled events, such as daily or hourly tasks.
-   **Document Event**: These scripts are triggered by specific events on DocTypes (e.g., `before_save`, `after_insert`).
-   **Permission Query**: These scripts modify the query used to fetch records based on user permissions.
  
### Events:  
  
-   Server Scripts can be hooked into various document events such as `before_insert`, `after_insert`, `before_save`, `after_save`, `before_submit`, `after_submit`, `before_cancel`, and `after_cancel`.
-   These events allow you to inject custom logic at different stages of a document's lifecycle.

  
### Create a Server Script:

LENS does not only manage the backend, it also comes with a feature rich admin interface called the Desk. When you create a DocType in LENS, a number of views are generated for it. Some of them are:

- List View supports filtering, sorting and editing of bulk records.
- Form View supports file attachments, PDF format, comments, email, etc.
- The Report Builder supports adding columns, grouping, filtering, sorting and saving it as a configuration.
