### **Write the Server Script Code**

**Create the Server Script:** Now, create the `validate_sales_invoice` method in a Python file (`custom_methods.py`).


``` javascript
import frappe

def validate_sales_invoice(doc, method):
    # Ensure the discount is not greater than 50%
    if doc.discount > 50:
        frappe.throw(_("Discount cannot exceed 50%"))
```

This method will be triggered every time a Sales Invoice is validated, preventing the invoice from being saved if the discount is too high.
