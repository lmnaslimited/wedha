# Document API

A Document is an instance of a DocType. It is derived from the  `frappe.model.Document`  class and represents a single record in the database table.

`frappe.get_doc` is a method in Frappe framework used to retrieve a document (record) from the database based on certain criteria. It allows you to work with the document object, which means you can access fields, manipulate data, and perform operations like saving, updating, or deleting the document.
