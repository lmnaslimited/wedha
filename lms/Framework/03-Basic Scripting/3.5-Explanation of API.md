# Document API

A Document is an instance of a DocType. It is derived from the  `frappe.model.Document`  class and represents a single record in the database table.

## frappe.get_doc ##

`frappe.get_doc` is a method in LENS used to retrieve a document (record) from the database based on certain criteria. It allows you to work with the document object, which means you can access fields, manipulate data, and perform operations like saving, updating, or deleting the document.
**Basic Syntax**

 ``` javascript
 doc = frappe.get_doc(doctype, name)
```
-   **doctype**: The type of document you want to retrieve (e.g., "Sales Invoice", "Customer").
-   **name**: The name or ID of the document (usually a unique identifier).

## frappe.get_meta ##
frappe.get_meta is a method in Frappe that provides metadata about a particular DocType. This metadata includes details about the fields, permissions, and other settings related to the DocType. It's useful for dynamically interacting with the structure and schema of documents in Frappe.
