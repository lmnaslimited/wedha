# Document API

A Document is an instance of a DocType. It is derived from the  `frappe.model.Document`  class and represents a single record in the database table.

## frappe.get_doc ##

`frappe.get_doc` is a method in LENS used to retrieve a document (record) from the database based on certai**strong text**n criteria. It allows you to work with the document object, which means you can access fields, manipulate data, and perform operations like saving, updating, or deleting the document.
**Basic Syntax**

 ``` javascript
 doc = frappe.get_doc(doctype, name)
```
-   **doctype**: The type of document you want to retrieve (e.g., "Sales Invoice", "Customer").
-   **name**: The name or ID of the document (usually a unique identifier).

## frappe.get_meta ##
`frappe.get_meta` is a method in LENS that provides metadata about a particular DocType. This metadata includes details about the fields, permissions, and other settings related to the DocType. It's useful for dynamically interacting with the structure and schema of documents .

**Basic Syntax**
``` javascript
meta = frappe.get_meta(doctype)
```
doctype: The type of document for which you want to retrieve metadata (e.g., "Sales Invoice", "Customer").

## frappe.get_all ##
`frappe.get_all` is a simpler method used to fetch records from a specific DocType. It returns a list of dictionaries, each representing a record.

``` javascript
records = frappe.get_all(doctype, fields=None, filters=None, limit=None)
