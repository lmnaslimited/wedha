# Document API

A Document is an instance of a DocType. It is derived from the  `frappe.model.Document`  class and represents a single record in the database table.

## frappe.get_doc ##

`frappe.get_doc` is a method in Frappe framework used to retrieve a document (record) from the database based on certain criteria. It allows you to work with the document object, which means you can access fields, manipulate data, and perform operations like saving, updating, or deleting the document.

**Basic Syntax**

 ``` javascript
 doc = frappe.get_doc(doctype, name)
```
-   **doctype**: The type of document you want to retrieve (e.g., "Sales Invoice", "Customer").
-   **name**: The name or ID of the document (usually a unique identifier).

## frappe.get_meta ##
`frappe.get_meta` is a method in LENS that provides metadata about a particular DocType. This metadata includes details about the fields, permissions, and other settings related to the DocType. It's useful for dynamically interacting with the structure and schema of documents .

**Basic Syntax**
``` javascript
meta = frappe.get_meta(doctype)
```
doctype: The type of document for which you want to retrieve metadata (e.g., "Sales Invoice", "Customer").

## frappe.get_all ##
`frappe.get_all` is a simpler method used to fetch records from a specific DocType. It returns a list of dictionaries, each representing a record.

**Basic Syntax**
``` javascript
records = frappe.get_all(doctype, fields=None, filters=None, limit=None)
```
-   doctype: The type of document you want to fetch (e.g., "Sales Invoice", "Customer").
-   fields: A list of field names you want to retrieve (e.g., ["name", "email_id"]).
-   filters: A dictionary of conditions to filter the records (e.g., {"status": "Open"}).
-   limit: The maximum number of records to fetch (e.g., 10).

## frappe.get_list
`frappe.get_list` provides more control and flexibility compared to `frappe.get_all`. It can also return metadata like the count of records.1
``` javascript
records = frappe.get_list(doctype, fields=None, filters=None, limit=None, order_by=None, start=None, page_length=None)
```
-   doctype: The type of document you want to fetch.
-   fields: A list of field names to retrieve.
-   filters: Conditions to filter records.
-   limit: The maximum number of records to fetch.
-   order_by: Specify how to order the results (e.g., "name desc"`).
-   star`: The starting point for pagination (offset).
-   page_length: Number of records per page.

## Document Methods

In LENS, document operations like saving, inserting, deleting, and reloading are handled through the document object methods. Here's an overview of each:

## save

**Purpose**: Saves the changes made to an existing document or inserts a new document if it doesn't already exist.

**Syntax**:
``` javascript
doc.save()
```
## insert
**Purpose**: Inserts a new document into the database. This method should be used for creating new records.

**Syntax**:
``` javascript
doc.insert()
```
## delete
**Purpose**: Deletes an existing document from the database.

**Syntax**:
``` javascript
doc.delete()
```

## reload
**Purpose**: Reloads the document from the database to reflect any changes made by other processes. This is useful when you need to refresh the document to get the latest data.

**Syntax**:
```javascript
doc.reload()
```
### Summary

-   **save()**: Save changes to an existing document or create a new one if it doesn't exist.
-   **insert()**: Insert a completely new document into the database.
-   **delete()**: Remove an existing document from the database.
-   **reload()`**: Refresh the document object to reflect any changes made externally.
