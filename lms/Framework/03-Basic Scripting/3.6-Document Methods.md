# Document Methods

In LENS, document operations like saving, inserting, deleting, and reloading are handled through the document object methods. Here's an overview of each:

## save

**Purpose**: Saves the changes made to an existing document or inserts a new document if it doesn't already exist.

**Syntax**:
``` javascript
doc.save()
```
## insert
**Purpose**: Inserts a new document into the database. This method should be used for creating new records.

**Syntax**:
``` javascript
doc.insert()
```
# delete
**Purpose**: Deletes an existing document from the database.

**Syntax**:
``` javascript
doc.delete()
```

## reload
**Purpose**: Reloads the document from the database to reflect any changes made by other processes. This is useful when you need to refresh the document to get the latest data.
