# Document Methods

In LENS, document operations like saving, inserting, deleting, and reloading are handled through the document object methods. Here's an overview of each:

## save

**Purpose**: Saves the changes made to an existing document or inserts a new document if it doesn't already exist.
**Syntax**:
``` javascript
doc.save()
```
## insert
**Purpose**: Inserts a new document into the database. This method should be used for creating new records.

**Syntax**:
``` javascript
`doc.insert()`
