#  Client Scripts

**Client Scripts** in Frappe allow you to add custom behavior and validation to forms directly within the user's browser. This enables dynamic interactions, real-time validations, and improved user experience without needing to refresh the page or make server requests.

-   **Purpose:** Enhance user interactions and validate forms on the client-side (in the browser).
-   **Languages:** JavaScript (often using Frappe’s built-in methods and APIs).
-   **Implementation:** Write scripts in the "Client Script" section of the DocType or use the `frappe.ui.form.on` method.

#### **1. Accessing Client Scripts**

   **Navigate to Client Scripts:**
    
    
 - Go to the Frappe Desk.
       
 - Open the module where you want to create or edit a Client Script.
           
 - Select "Client Script" from the module list or use the
   search bar.

 **Creating a New Client Script:**
    
    
 - Click on “New” to create a new Client Script.

    

 - Choose the **DocType** you want to apply the script to (e.g., Sales
   Invoice).

 - Set the **Script Type** (e.g., JavaScript).

#### **2. Common Events:**
    
    **onload**: Triggered when the form is loaded.
**refresh** : Triggered when the form is refreshed.
**validate**: Triggered before the form is saved
**change**: Triggered when a field value changes.
