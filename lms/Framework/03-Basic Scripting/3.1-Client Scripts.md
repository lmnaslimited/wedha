#  Client Scripts

**Client Scripts** in Frappe allow you to add custom behavior and validation to forms directly within the user's browser. This enables dynamic interactions, real-time validations, and improved user experience without needing to refresh the page or make server requests.

-   **Purpose:** Enhance user interactions and validate forms on the client-side (in the browser).
-   **Languages:** JavaScript (often using Frappe’s built-in methods and APIs).
-   **Examples:** Custom validations, dynamic field updates, and form enhancements.
-   **Implementation:** Write scripts in the "Client Script" section of the DocType or use the `frappe.ui.form.on` method.
