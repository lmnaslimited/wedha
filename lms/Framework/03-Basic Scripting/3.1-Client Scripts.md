#  Client Scripts

**Client Script** in LENS is a JavaScript-based script that runs on the client-side (browser) and is used to manipulate or modify the behavior of forms, fields, or interactions within the LENS system.

- **Client-side scripting**: Client scripts are executed on the user's browser rather than the server.
- **Purpose**: They are used to add custom behavior to forms, such as auto-filling fields, performing validations, showing/hiding fields, or creating dependencies between fields.
-   **Languages:** JavaScript (often using LENS built-in methods and APIs).
