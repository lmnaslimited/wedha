### 1. **Create a New User**

#### **Step-by-Step Instructions**:

    -   Go to **Explore** > **Users and Permissions** > **User**.
2.  **Create a New User**:
    
    -   Click on **New** to create a new user.
    -   Fill in the details:
        -   **Email Address**: Enter the email address of the new user (e.g., `john.doe@example.com`).
        -   **Full Name**: Enter the user’s full name.
        -   **Username**: (Optional) Username can be auto-generated based on the email.
3.  **Assign Roles**:
    
    -   Scroll down to the **Roles** section.
    -   Assign relevant roles to this user based on their job responsibilities.
        -   **Role**: Choose the role(s) you want to assign (e.g., Sales User, Accounts User).
        -   Click on **Add Row** to assign additional roles.
    -   **Save** the user.
#### Expected Outcome:

You’ve created a new user and assigned them specific roles like **Sales User** and **Accounts User**.

### 2. **Set Up Role Permissions for Sales Order and Sales Invoice**

#### **Step-by-Step Instructions**:

1.  **Navigate to Role Permissions Manager**:
    
    -   Go to **Explore** > **Users and Permissions** > **Role Permissions Manager**.
2.  **Select Doctype and Role**:
    
    -   In the **Document Type** dropdown, choose **Sales Order**.
    -   In the **Role** dropdown, choose **Sales User** (or whichever role you assigned).
3.  **Set Permissions**:
    
    -   Under the **Permissions** section, configure access for the selected role:
        -   **Read**: Allow the user to view **Sales Orders**.
        -   **Create**: Allow the user to create new **Sales Orders**.
        -   **Write**: Allow the user to edit existing **Sales Orders**.
        -   **Submit**: Allow the user to submit **Sales Orders**.
        -   **Cancel**: Allow the user to cancel **Sales Orders**.
    -   Check or uncheck these options based on the level of access the role should have.
4.  **Save** the Permissions.
    
5.  **Repeat for Other Doctypes**:
    
    -   If you want to set permissions for **Sales Invoice** as well, follow the same steps by selecting **Sales Invoice** in the **Document Type** dropdown and adjusting permissions for the role **Accounts User**.

#### Expected Outcome:

-   The **Sales User** role will now have specific permissions for **Sales Order**.
-   The **Accounts User** role will have permissions for **Sales Invoice**.
