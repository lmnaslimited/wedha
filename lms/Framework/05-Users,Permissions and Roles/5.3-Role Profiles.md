# Role Profiles
  
Role Profiles simplify the process of managing permissions by allowing you to assign a complete set of permissions to users at once, based on their role within the organization. This lesson will guide you through creating, managing, and assigning Role Profiles to ensure that users have the appropriate access levels according to their responsibilities.

### 1. Access the Role Permissions Manager:
Navigate to **Users and Permissions > Role Permissions Manager** by typing it in the search bar or finding it in the sidebar menu.

### 2. Select the Doctype:
-   In the Role Permissions Manager, you'll see a dropdown menu labeled **Select Document Type**.
-   Choose the Doctype for which you want to set permissions. For example, you might select "Sales Order," "Employee," or any other Doctype relevant to your application.

### 3. Choose the Role:
   
-   Once the Doctype is selected, another dropdown will appear labeled **Select Role**.
-   Choose the role that you want to set permissions for. For instance, if youâ€™re setting permissions for the "Sales User" role, select it from the list.
- 
### 4. Set Permissions:
-   After selecting the role, you'll see a matrix of checkboxes corresponding to different permissions:
    -  **Read**: Allows users to view records.
    -   **Write**: Allows users to modify existing records.
    -   **Create**: Allows users to create new records.
    -   **Delete**: Allows users to delete records.
    -   **Submit**: Allows users to submit documents (often used for workflow approval).
    -   **Cancel**: Allows users to cancel documents.
    -   **Amend**: Allows users to amend (make changes to) submitted documents.
-   Check or uncheck the boxes according to what actions you want the selected role to perform on the selected Doctype.
### 5. Save Permissions
After configuring the permissions, click the **Update** button to save the changes.
