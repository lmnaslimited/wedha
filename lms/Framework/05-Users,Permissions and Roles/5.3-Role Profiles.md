# Role Profiles
  
Role Profiles simplify the process of managing permissions by allowing you to assign a complete set of permissions to users at once, based on their role within the organization. This lesson will guide you through creating, managing, and assigning Role Profiles to ensure that users have the appropriate access levels according to their responsibilities.

## Steps to Create and Manage Role Profiles

### 1. Navigate to Role Profile:
Use the search bar or sidebar to navigate to **Users and Permissions > Role Profile**.
### 2. Create a New Role Profile:
-   In the Role Profile list, click on the **New** button to create a new Role Profile.
-   A form will appear where you can define the **Role Profile Name** (e.g., "HR Manager", "Sales Executive").
-   You can also add a description for better understanding of the Role Profile's purpose.

### 3. Add Roles to the Role Profile:
   
-   After creating a Role Profile, scroll to the section labeled **Roles**.
-   Click **Add Row** and select multiple roles from the dropdown list to assign to this Role Profile. For example, a "Sales Executive" Role Profile might include the roles of "Sales User," "Accounts User," and "Stock User."
-   Add as many roles as needed to define the complete set of permissions for this profile.

### .Assign Role Profiles to Users:
-   To assign a Role Profile to a user, go to the **User** list by navigating to **Users and Permissions > User**.
-   Select the user you wish to assign the Role Profile to, or create a new user.
-   In the User form, find the **Role Profile** dropdown.
-   Select the appropriate Role Profile from the list.
-   The roles associated with the profile will automatically populate in the **Roles** section.
