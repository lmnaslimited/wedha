# Role Profiles
  
Role Profiles simplify the process of managing permissions by allowing you to assign a complete set of permissions to users at once, based on their role within the organization. This lesson will guide you through creating, managing, and assigning Role Profiles to ensure that users have the appropriate access levels according to their responsibilities.

## Steps to Create and Manage Role Profiles

### 1. Navigate to Role Profile:
Use the search bar or sidebar to navigate to **Users and Permissions > Role Profile**.
### 2. Create a New Role Profile:
-   In the Role Profile list, click on the **New** button to create a new Role Profile.
-   A form will appear where you can define the **Role Profile Name** (e.g., "HR Manager", "Sales Executive").
-   You can also add a description for better understanding of the Role Profile's purpose.

### 3. Add Roles to the Role Profile:
   

### 4. Set Permissions:
-   After selecting the role, you'll see a matrix of checkboxes corresponding to different permissions:
    -  **Read**: Allows users to view records.
    -   **Write**: Allows users to modify existing records.
    -   **Create**: Allows users to create new records.
    -   **Delete**: Allows users to delete records.
    -   **Submit**: Allows users to submit documents (often used for workflow approval).
    -   **Cancel**: Allows users to cancel documents.
    -   **Amend**: Allows users to amend (make changes to) submitted documents.
-   Check or uncheck the boxes according to what actions you want the selected role to perform on the selected Doctype.
### 5. Save Permissions
After configuring the permissions, click the **Update** button to save the changes.
