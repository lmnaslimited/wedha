# Set Permissions on Doctypes 
  
By configuring permissions, you can ensure that users only have access to the information and actions that are relevant to their roles. This is crucial for maintaining data security and operational efficiency.

### 1. Access the Role Permissions Manager:
Navigate to **Users and Permissions > Role Permissions Manager** by typing it in the search bar or finding it in the sidebar menu.
### 2. Select the Doctype:
-   In the Role Permissions Manager, you'll see a dropdown menu labeled **Select Document Type**.
-   Choose the Doctype for which you want to set permissions. For example, you might select "Sales Order," "Employee," or any other Doctype relevant to your application.

### 1. Navigate to the Role List:
   Type **Role** in the search bar or go to **Users and Permissions > Role** from the sidebar menu.
    
 ### 2. Create a New Role:
 -   In the Role list view, click on the **New** button.
-   A new form will open where you can define the role’s name, such as "Project Manager" or "Finance Executive".

### 3. Define Permissions for the Role:
-   After creating the role, you might want to customize its permissions. You can do this by navigating to the **Role Permissions Manager** under **Users and Permissions**.
-   Select the newly created role and the Doctypes it will interact with.
-   Set the permissions like read, write, create, delete, etc., according to what this role should be able to do.
- Click on **"Save"**

## Assign Roles to the User

-   Go to the User, Scroll down to the **Roles** section within the User form.
-   Click **Add Row** to add roles. For example, you might assign the "Sales User" role to someone in sales or "HR Manager" to someone in human resources.
-   You can assign multiple roles depending on the user’s responsibilities.
