# **Lesson 8: CSS Positioning**

CSS positioning allows you to control the placement of elements on a web page.

## **Position Property**

The `position` property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element. There are five different position values:

1. **`static`**:  
   - The default positioning method. Elements are positioned according to the normal document flow. The `top`, `left`, `right`, and `bottom` properties do not apply.

2. **`relative`**:  
   - The element is positioned relative to its normal position. The `top`, `left`, `right`, and `bottom` properties can be used to adjust the element's position without removing it from the document flow.

3. **`fixed`**:  
   - The element is positioned relative to the browser window (viewport) and remains fixed when the page is scrolled. It is removed from the normal document flow.

4. **`absolute`**:  
   - The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an element with `relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed` positioning). If no ancestor is positioned, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport). It is removed from the normal document flow.

5. **`sticky`**:  
   - The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position. It toggles between `relative` and `fixed` positioning depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a certain point, then it sticks in place (fixed) as the page scrolls.

## **Combining Positioning Techniques**

Positioning techniques can be combined for more complex layouts. For example, an absolutely positioned element can be contained within a relatively positioned parent.

This overview of the `position` property in CSS explains how different positioning methods—static, relative, fixed, absolute, and sticky—can be used to control the placement and behavior of elements on a web page.
