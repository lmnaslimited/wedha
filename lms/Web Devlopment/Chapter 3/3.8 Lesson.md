# **Lesson 8: CSS Positioning**

CSS positioning allows you to control the exact placement of elements on a web page, enabling you to create more complex layouts and designs. There are five primary positioning methods: `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`

## **Position Property**

The `position` property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element. There are five different position values:

1. **`static`**:  
   - The default positioning method. Elements are positioned according to the normal document flow. The `top`, `left`, `right`, and `bottom` properties do not apply.

2. **`relative`**:  
   - The element is positioned relative to its normal position. The `top`, `left`, `right`, and `bottom` properties can be used to adjust the element's position without removing it from the document flow.
  
	  **Properties:** 
	   - **`top`**: Moves the element down if positive, up if negative. 
	   - **`left`**: Moves the element right if positive, left if negative
	   - **`right`**: Moves the element left if positive, right if negative. 
	   - **`bottom`**: Moves the element up if positive, down if negative.

3. **`fixed`**:  
   - The element is positioned relative to the browser window (viewport) and remains fixed when the page is scrolled. It is removed from the normal document flow.
	
		**Properties**: Functions like absolute positioning but always relative to the viewport.

4. **`absolute`**:  
   - The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an element with `relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed` positioning). If no ancestor is positioned, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport). It is removed from the normal document flow.
   
	   **Properties**: Similar to relative positioning, but the element is removed from the normal flow. 

5. **`sticky`**:  
   - The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position. It toggles between `relative` and `fixed` positioning depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a certain point, then it sticks in place (fixed) as the page scrolls.

## **Combining Positioning Techniques**

Positioning methods can be combined for more complex layouts. For instance, an element with `position: absolute` can be placed inside a parent element with `position: relative`. This allows the child element to be positioned relative to the parent rather than the entire document.
```css
.parent {
    position: relative;
    width: 300px;
    height: 200px;
    background-color: lightblue;
}

.child {
    position: absolute;
    top: 10px;
    left: 20px;
    width: 100px;
    height: 50px;
    background-color: coral;
}
```
In this example, the `.child` element is positioned 10px from the top and 20px from the left of the `.parent` element, instead of the entire document.
