# **Lesson 2: CSS Syntax and Selectors**

Learn the basic syntax of CSS and the different types of selectors, including element, class, and ID selectors. We'll also cover grouping and combining selectors for more efficient styling.

## **CSS Syntax**

CSS rules are written in a specific syntax that consists of selectors and declarations.

- **Selector:** The HTML element you want to style.
- **Declaration:** The styling you want to apply, including properties and values.

**Basic Syntax:**

```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```
