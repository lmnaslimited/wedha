# **Lesson 2: CSS Syntax and Selectors**

Learn the basic syntax of CSS and the different types of selectors, including element, class, and ID selectors. We'll also cover grouping and combining selectors for more efficient styling.

## **CSS Syntax**

CSS rules are written in a specific syntax that consists of selectors and declarations.

- **Selector:** The HTML element you want to style.
- **Declaration:** The styling you want to apply, including properties and values.

**Basic Syntax:**

```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```

**Example:**
```css
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
}
```
-   `h1` is the selector.
-   `color` and `font-size` are properties.
-   `blue` and `24px` are the values.

## **Types of Selectors**

1.  **Element Selector**
    
    -   Targets HTML elements directly by their name.
        
    -   **Example:**
	    ```css
		p {
		    color: red;
		}
		```

	- This will apply the style to all `<p>` elements.

2.  **Class Selector**
    
    -   Targets elements with a specific class attribute. Use a period (`.`) before the class name.        
    -   **Example:**
	```css
.highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
}
```

	- This will apply the style to all `<p>` elements.
