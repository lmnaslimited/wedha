# **Lesson 1: Introduction to CSS**

## **What is CSS?**

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to control the appearance and layout of web pages. It works with HTML to style elements, including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.

## **Important CSS Syntax**

- **Selector:** The HTML element you want to style.
- **Property:** The aspect of the element you want to change (e.g., color, font-size).
- **Value:** The specific setting for that property.

**Example:**

```css
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
}
```

-   `h1` is the selector.
-   `color` and `font-size` are properties.
-   `blue` and `24px` are the values.
