# **Lesson 1: Introduction to CSS**

## **What is CSS?**

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to control the appearance and layout of web pages. It works with HTML to style elements, including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.


## **Why is CSS Important?**

-   **Consistency:** CSS allows you to maintain a consistent design across multiple pages.
-   **Efficiency:** One CSS file can style an entire website, reducing redundancy.
-   **Responsiveness:** CSS helps make websites adaptable to different screen sizes.


## **Important CSS Syntax**

- **Selector:** The HTML element you want to style.
- **Property:** The aspect of the element you want to change (e.g., color, font-size).
- **Value:** The specific setting for that property.

**Example:**

```css
h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
}
```
-   `h1` is the selector.
-   `color` and `font-size` are properties.
-   `blue` and `24px` are the values.

# **How CSS Works with HTML**

CSS styles are applied to HTML elements using different methods:

-   **Inline CSS:** Directly within the HTML element using the `style` attribute.
-   **Internal CSS:** Within a `<style>` tag in the HTML `<head>`.
-   **External CSS:** In a separate `.css` file linked to the HTML document.
