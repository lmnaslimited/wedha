CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to control the appearance and layout of web pages. It works with HTML to style elements, including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning.


## **Why is CSS Important?**

-   **Consistency:** CSS allows you to maintain a consistent design across multiple pages.
-   **Efficiency:** One CSS file can style an entire website, reducing redundancy.
-   **Responsiveness:** CSS helps make websites adaptable to different screen sizes.

#### **How CSS Enhances Web Pages** 
- **Styling Elements:** CSS lets you control the look of HTML elements, such as changing the color of text, adjusting the size of headings, or adding background images. 
 - **Layout Control:** CSS provides tools to manage the layout of a web page, including positioning elements, creating multi-column layouts, and designing responsive pages that adapt to different screen sizes. 
 - **Animation and Interaction:** CSS can be used to add simple animations and transitions, making web pages more interactive and engaging for users.
