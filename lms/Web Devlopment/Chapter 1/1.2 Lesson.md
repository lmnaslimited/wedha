# **Lesson 2: What is WWW/HTTP/URL?**

## **What is the World Wide Web (WWW)?**
The World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of web pages and related content identified by URLs. It allows users to browse and interact with these pages using web browsers.

To see an example of the very first website ever hosted, check out this [historic webpage](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). It provides a glimpse into the origins of the web!

## **What is a URL?**
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access websites. It tells your browser where to find a specific resource on the web. For example, `https://www.example.com` is a URL.

- **Protocol** (`https://`): → The method used to transfer data securely.
- **Resource Name** (`www.example.com`): → The address of the website you want to visit.

## **What is HTTP/HTTPS?**
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) are protocols used to transfer data between your web browser and a website. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, encrypting data to keep it safe.

## **Interactive Example: How the Internet and WWW Work Together**
Imagine the WWW as a giant library:
- **WWW**: The library where all the books (websites) are stored.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: The rules for borrowing and returning books (transferring data).
- **URL**: The library catalog number you use to find a specific book (web address).

When you request a web page, it’s like asking the librarian for a book using its catalog number (URL). The request travels through the library (the internet) to the book’s location (web server), and then the book (web page) is sent back to you!
