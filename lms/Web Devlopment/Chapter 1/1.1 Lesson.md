# **Lesson 1: What is the Internet?**

## **What is the Internet?**
The internet is a global network that connects millions of computers and devices, allowing them to communicate and share information. It functions like a vast web where data travels between users and servers.

## **How the Internet Works**

Think of the internet like a magical mail system. You write a letter, put it in an envelope, and drop it in a mailbox. The letter travels through post offices until it reaches your friend's house.

On the internet, sending data is like sending a letter. Data travels through different "internet post offices" (servers) until it reaches its destination. When the data arrives, your computer displays the website or content you requested.

So, just like sending and receiving letters, the internet sends and receives information to help you see websites and videos!

## **What is the World Wide Web (WWW)?**
The World Wide Web (WWW) is a collection of web pages and related content identified by URLs. It allows users to browse and interact with these pages using web browsers.

To see an example of the very first website ever hosted, check out this [historic webpage](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). It provides a glimpse into the origins of the web!

## **What is a URL?**
A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access websites. It tells your browser where to find a specific resource on the web. For example, `https://www.example.com` is a URL.

- **Protocol** (`https://`): → The method used to transfer data securely.
- **Resource Name** (`www.example.com`): → The address of the website you want to visit.

## **What is HTTP/HTTPS?**
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) are protocols used to transfer data between your web browser and a website. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, encrypting data to keep it safe.

## **Interactive Example: How the Internet and WWW Work Together**
Imagine the WWW as a giant library:
- **WWW**: The library where all the books (websites) are stored.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: The rules for borrowing and returning books (transferring data).
- **URL**: The library catalog number you use to find a specific book (web address).

When you request a web page, it’s like asking the librarian for a book using its catalog number (URL). The request travels through the library (the internet) to the book’s location (web server), and then the book (web page) is sent back to you!
