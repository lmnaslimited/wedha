# **Lesson 1: Understanding the Internet**

## **What is the Internet?**

The internet is a global network that connects millions of computers and devices, allowing them to communicate and share information.

## **How the Internet Works**

Data on the internet is like sending letters through a mail system. It travels through servers until it reaches its destination, where your computer displays the content.

## **What is the World Wide Web (WWW)?**

The WWW is a collection of web pages and content identified by URLs, accessible via web browsers.

Explore the first website ever hosted: [Historic Webpage](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html).

## **What is a URL?**

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access websites. For example, `https://www.example.com`.

-   **Protocol** (`https://`): Method for secure data transfer.
-   **Resource Name** (`www.example.com`): Address of the website.

## **What is HTTP/HTTPS?**

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) are protocols for transferring data between browsers and websites. HTTPS is the secure version, encrypting data.

## **Interactive Example: How the Internet and WWW Work Together**

-   **WWW**: A library with all the books (websites).
-   **HTTP/HTTPS**: Rules for borrowing and returning books (data transfer).
-   **URL**: Catalog number to find a specific book (web address).

Requesting a web page is like asking for a book using its catalog number. The request travels through the internet to the web server, and the page is sent back to you!
