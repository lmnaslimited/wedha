# **Lesson 2: Frontend and Backend Explained**

## **What is Frontend Development?**
Frontend development involves creating the visual and interactive parts of a website that users see and interact with. It includes the design and layout of web pages.

## **What is Backend Development?**
Backend development focuses on the server-side of a website, handling data storage, server logic, and communication between the server and the userâ€™s browser.

## **How Do Frontend and Backend Work Together?**
Frontend and backend work together to create a complete website. Frontend is what users interact with, while backend handles the behind-the-scenes processes.

### **Interactive Example**

Think of a website as a restaurant:

-   **Frontend**: The menu, tables, and decor that customers see (user interface).
-   **Backend**: The kitchen and staff that prepare and manage the food (server-side operations).

When you place an order (frontend action), the kitchen (backend) processes it and sends the food back to you.
