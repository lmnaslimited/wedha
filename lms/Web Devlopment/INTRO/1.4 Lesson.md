# **Lesson 4: Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

## **What is HTML?**
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) creates the structure of web pages. It defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images.

## **What is CSS?**
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) styles web pages. It changes how HTML elements look, including colors, fonts, and layout.

## **What is JavaScript?**
JavaScript adds interactivity to web pages. It makes things like animations and form validation possible.

## **How HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Work Together**
Building a webpage is like building a house:
- **HTML**: Provides the basic structure and layout of the house.
- **CSS**: Adds color, style, and design to make the house look appealing.
- **JavaScript**: Introduces interactive features like lights and doors that respond to actions.

HTML sets up the structure, CSS adds style, and JavaScript makes it interactive!
