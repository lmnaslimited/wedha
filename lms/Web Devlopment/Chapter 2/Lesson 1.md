# Lesson 1: Introduction to HTML

## What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the basic structure of a website, which can be enhanced with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.

## A Simple HTML Document

### Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

- The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document.
- The `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page.
- The `<head>` element contains meta information about the HTML page.
- The `<title>` element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab).
- The `<body>` element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
- The `<h1>` element defines a large heading.
- The `<p>` element defines a paragraph.
