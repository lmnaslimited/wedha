# **Task 3: Add a Contact Form with Navigation**

### **Objective**

Create a contact form on a new page and ensure that users can navigate from the home page to the contact page through the navbar. This task will help you practice linking pages and designing functional forms.

### **Instructions**

1.  **Create the Home Page Navbar**:
    
    -   Add a link to the contact page in the navbar on your home page.
    -   Use an unordered list (`<ul>`) with list items (`<li>`) for navigation.

2. **Create the Contact Page**:

	-   Add a new HTML file named `contact.html`.
	-   Include a simple contact form using `<form>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<button>` elements.

3. **Link the Contact Page from the Home Page**:
    
    -   Ensure the home pageâ€™s navbar includes a link to the `contact.html` page.
    
4.  **Test Navigation**:
    
    -   Preview both the home page and contact page in your browser to ensure that the navigation works correctly and that the contact form is functional.

### **Submission**

-   **Home Page HTML**: Submit the updated home page HTML file with the navbar link to the contact page.
-   **Contact Page HTML**: Submit the new contact page HTML file with the contact form.
-   **Preview Link**: Optionally, provide a link to your live preview if hosted online.

Great job! Keep up the good work and have fun building your contact form! ðŸš€
