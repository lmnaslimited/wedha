## **Practice 2: Preview and Test Your HTML Code**

**Objective:** Preview your HTML file using Live Server and test browser compatibility.

**Steps:**

1.  **Open Your HTML File in VS Code:**
    
    -   Open the `index.html` file in Visual Studio Code.
2.  **Preview with Live Server:**
    
    -   Right-click on the HTML file in VS Code and select "Open with Live Server" to view the page in your browser.

## **Practice 3: Add Comments to Your HTML Code**

**Objective:** Document your HTML code using comments for better readability and maintenance.

**Steps:**

1.  **Add Comments to Your HTML File:**
    -   Open your `index.html` file.
    -   Add comments to explain different sections of your HTML code. For example, add comments before the header, main content, and any images or other sections.
