# **What are HTML Entities?**

HTML entities are used to display reserved characters, special symbols, or characters that are not easily typed using a keyboard. They start with an ampersand (`&`) and end with a semicolon (`;`).

## **Common HTML Entities**

-   **`&nbsp;`**: Represents a non-breaking space.
-   **`&copy;`**: Represents the copyright symbol (©).
-   **`&amp;`**: Represents the ampersand symbol (&).
-   **`&lt;`**: Represents the less-than symbol (<).
-   **`&gt;`**: Represents the greater-than symbol (>).
-   **`&euro;`**: Represents the Euro currency symbol (€).
-   **`&quot;`**: Represents the double quotation mark (").
-   **`&apos;`**: Represents the apostrophe (').

## **Why Use HTML Entities?**

-   **Display Reserved Characters:** Some characters like `<`, `>`, and `&` have special meanings in HTML. Using entities allows you to display these characters as text.
-   **Display Special Characters:** Entities represent characters that aren't available on your keyboard, like `&copy;` for the copyright symbol.
- **Ensure Proper Display Across Different Browsers:** Using entities can help ensure that characters are displayed consistently across various browsers and platforms.
