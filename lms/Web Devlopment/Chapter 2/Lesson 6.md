# **Lesson 6: HTML Lists**

## **What are HTML Lists?**

HTML lists are used to group related items together. There are two main types of lists in HTML: ordered lists and unordered lists.

## **Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)**

An unordered list is a collection of items that do not have a specific order. The list items are typically marked with bullet points.

### **Basic Structure:**
```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```
