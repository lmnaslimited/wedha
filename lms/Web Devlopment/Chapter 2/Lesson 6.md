# **Lesson 6: HTML Lists**

## **What are HTML Lists?**

HTML lists are used to group related items together. There are two main types of lists in HTML: ordered lists and unordered lists.

## **Unordered Lists (`<ul>`)**

An unordered list is a collection of items that do not have a specific order. The list items are typically marked with bullet points.

### **Basic Structure:**
```html
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```
## **Ordered Lists (`<ol>`)**

An ordered list is a collection of items that are presented in a specific sequence. The list items are typically marked with numbers or letters.

### **Basic Structure:**
```html
<ol>
    <li>First Item</li>
    <li>Second Item</li>
    <li>Third Item</li>
</ol>
```

## **HTML Description Lists**

Description lists are used to present terms and their descriptions.

### **Basic Structure:**
```html
<dl>
    <dt>Term 1</dt>
    <dd>Description for Term 1.</dd>
    
    <dt>Term 2</dt>
    <dd>Description for Term 2.</dd>
    
    <!-- Add more terms and descriptions as needed -->
</dl>
```
