# **Lesson 2: Writing, Previewing, and Testing HTML**

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to write HTML code in VS Code, preview it in real-time with Live Server, check for browser compatibility, and document your code using comments.

## **1. Writing HTML Code in VS Code**

-   **Create a New HTML File**:
    -   Open VS Code.
    -   Create a new file and save it with a `.html` extension (e.g., `index.html`).
    -   Start writing your HTML code inside this file.

## **2. Previewing with Live Server**

-   **Live Preview**:
    -   Use the Live Server extension in VS Code to view your HTML page in a browser as you code.
    -   **Steps**: Right-click on your HTML file in VS Code and select "Open with Live Server."
    -   **Note**: If Live Server isn’t installed, refer to Chapter 1, Lesson 5 for installation instructions.

## **3. Checking Browser Compatibility**

-   **Why It’s Important**:
    -   Ensure your HTML code displays correctly across different web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
-   **How to Check**:
    -   Use browser developer tools (F12 or right-click > Inspect) to inspect elements and test your code.
    -   Make adjustments as needed for different browsers.

## **4. Using HTML Comments**

-   **Adding Comments**:
    -   Syntax: `<!-- Comment -->`
    -   **Purpose**: Use comments to document sections of your HTML code, making it easier to understand and maintain.
