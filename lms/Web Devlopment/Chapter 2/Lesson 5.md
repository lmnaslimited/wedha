# **Lesson 5: HTML Boilerplate**

## **What is HTML Boilerplate?**

HTML boilerplate is a basic structure that serves as the foundation for creating a well-structured HTML document. It ensures that your document is properly set up for consistent rendering across different browsers and devices.

## **Basic HTML Boilerplate Structure**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Title</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
	<!-- Content -->
</body>
</html>
```

## **Components of the Boilerplate**

1.  **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
2.  **`<html lang="en">`**: The root element of the document, with a language attribute.
3.  **`<head>`**: Contains metadata and links to resources.
    -   **`<meta charset="UTF-8">`**: Sets the character encoding.
    -   **`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`**: Ensures responsive design on mobile devices.
    -   **`<title>`**: Defines the title of the document.
    -   **`<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`**: Links to an external CSS file.
4.  **`<body>`**: Contains the visible content of the document, such as text, images, and links. This is what users see on the webpage.

## **Significance of the Boilerplate**

-   **Consistency**: Offers a standardized starting point for HTML documents.
-   **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensures proper rendering across different browsers.
-   **Responsive Design**: Facilitates layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.
-   **Separation of Concerns**: Distinguishes HTML structure from CSS and JavaScript for easier maintenance.

## **VS Code Shortcut**

To quickly add the HTML boilerplate code in Visual Studio Code, use the following shortcut:

1.  Open a new file or an existing HTML file.
2.  Type `!` and press `Tab` or `Enter`.

This will automatically generate the basic HTML boilerplate code for you, speeding up your workflow.
