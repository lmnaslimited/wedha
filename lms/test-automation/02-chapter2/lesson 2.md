# **Assertion in Cypress**

Assertions in Cypress are used to verify that certain conditions are true during a test, ensuring that the application behaves as expected. They help confirm whether elements exist, have the correct text, are visible, or meet other criteria, validating that the actual outcome matches the expected result. Assertions are crucial in automated testing for validating the state of your application and ensuring it functions correctly across different scenarios.

# **Features**

### Cross-Browser Testing:

Cypress supports multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, allowing you to test across different environments.

### Support for Modern JavaScript:

Cypress supports modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries out of the box, including React, Angular, Vue, and others.

### Real-Time Browser Preview:

Cypress provides a real-time preview of your application and the tests running against it. This helps you see exactly whatâ€™s happening during test execution.

### Automatic Waiting:

Cypress automatically waits for elements to appear, animations to  
complete, and XHR requests to finish, reducing the need for manual wait commands.

### Screenshots, Videos, and Test Replay: 

View screenshots taken automatically on failure, or videos, if enabled, of your entire test suite when run from the CLI. Record to  [Cypress Cloud]  and replay the test as it executed during the run for zero-configuration debugging using  [Test Replay].
