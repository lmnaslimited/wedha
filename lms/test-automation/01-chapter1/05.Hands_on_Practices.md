**Practice 1**

**Objective:**  Create a new spec in Cypress using JavaScript.

**Steps:**

1.  Assuming you've successfully  installed Cypress and opened Cypress now it's time to add your first test. We're going to do this with the **Create new empty spec** button.
    
2.  Open Cypress for the first time to create the default folder structure:
    
	```bash
	npx cypress open
	```
 3. **Create a New Spec File**

- Your test files (specs) will go inside the `cypress/e2e` folder .
- Create a new JavaScript file in the appropriate folder. 

   **For Example:**
	```bash
	File_name.cy.js
	```
4.  Even though we haven't written any code yet - that's okay - let's click on your new spec and watch Cypress launch it. Cypress will visit `https://example.cypress.io` and the test passes.

**Practice 2**

**Objective:** Write a basic test to open a demolens and login to the page.

**Steps:**

1.  Create a new test file in the **cypress/e2e** directory:
    
    ```bash
    test1.cy.js
    ```
    
2.  Open **test1.cy.js** in your code editor and add the following code:
    

 ```javascript
describe('template spec', () => {
it('passes', () => {
cy.visit('https://qsgbcz.lmnas.com/login#login');

```

  This script visits a specific YouTube video page and checks for the presence of the video player, the video title, and the subscribe button.

**Hints:**

-   Use `cy.visit()` to navigate to a URL.
-   Use `cy.get()` to select DOM elements and perform assertions on them.

**Expected Outcome:**

-   The test should open the specified YouTube video page, check for the video playerâ€™s presence, verify the video title, and ensure the subscribe button is visible.
