# Pre-Requisites

Cypress requires the following packages to be installed:

-   Node.js
-   npm

## 1. Install Node.js and npm

First, ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your Ubuntu system.

### Install Node.js and npm

Open a terminal and run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm
``` 

This command installs Node.js and npm, the package manager for Node.js.
> **Note**:

### Verify Node.js and npm installation

After installation, verify the versions to ensure everything is set up correctly:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see the installed versions of Node.js and npm printed in the terminal.

## 2. Install Cypress

### Installation command

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it. Then, initialize a new Node.js project and install Cypress:

```bash
mkdir my-cypress-project
cd my-cypress-project
npm init -y
npm install cypress
```

This creates a new `package.json` file and installs Cypress as a dependency.

### Verify Cypress installation

To confirm that Cypress is installed correctly, run:

```bash
npx cypress verify
```

This command verifies the installation and ensures Cypress is ready to use.

## 3. Open Cypress

Finally, open Cypress using the following command:

```bash
npx cypress open 
```

This command launches the Cypress Test Runner, where you can start creating and running tests.

With these steps, you should have Cypress installed and ready to use on your Ubuntu system.
